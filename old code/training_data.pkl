aV Part 1:   Process Narrative   (Word Count: 2449/2500)   1.1  Introduction     Binghamton University was founded  in 1946 as a liberal arts college  in Endicott , NY ,   on land donated  by  IBM   and  Endicott Johnson  manufacturing jobs  reached its nadir. T he institution , relocated in 1950 to a hillside in Vestal and  i ncorporated  into the  SUNY   system   as one of four research centers , has retained its   core , founding   values of providing a   high quality , well - rounded education and , to this end,   partnering w ith industry . To preserve these  values, the  institution shifted its  identity   during the past fifteen years to become the anchor institution of this community,  and   its main driver of economic revitalization.

aVSince the nine  rial innovation. Thriving  cigar manufacturing companies utilized the confluence of the Chenango and Susquehanna Rivers in  downtown Binghamton to transport their products.  Following the collapse of the cigar industry,  Endicott - Johnson Shoe   Company   founded   two   municipalities   and constructed   employee  hous ing districts ,  first  Johnson  City , an d later,  Endicott .  Today, as  one of   s , 1   our     revita lizing the local community meet   with the challenge s   of  determining how best to increase   e conomic  prosperity and expand   our presence  across   thirteen municipalities.

aVThe I E P designation  application process  allowed   our campus and community  to take   stock of   our  efforts and learn  how  stakeholder s   perce ive   the insti  economic engagement  role and progress with  meeting community   needs .  W e   identified our strengths and   where   we need to grow. The process assisted  our  stakeholder s   with  better understand ing   our   id entity as an economic generator . Since our student  body
p13
aV   4     expanded during the twenty - first century beyond  the  sta te to include global po pulations , we  also  reached out  to our alumni   base (all regional   and recent alumn i globally) , to gauge our progress.
p14
aVBased on  our  history  and   what we learned from our stakeholders, we define economic prosperity  as the  state of a community that sustains a  quality of life for all residents, a result of economic opportunities for all ,   absent harm  inflicted   on   other   communities. An economically prosperous community makes  possible  employment and educational opportunities that challenge and fulfill ,   while suppor ting opportunities for  renewal and  growth . Such communities defy stasis because they see a constant maintenance and renewal of  community infrastructure to support further growth, and they help spur economic prosperity in  surrounding  communities.    Our under standing of innovation grows from this definition of economic prosperity, and economically  prosperous communities act as magnets and catalysts for innovation.  Innovation is the process whereby known  or new   dots  , as exemplified by information, concepts, p rocesses, or products that are developed, discovered,  rediscovered or repurposed, are connected in new ways or for new purposes and where the outcome has utility  or tangible value to a set of stakeholders. Innovation can occur spontaneously and unintention ally or it can be  catalyzed and  managed. Innovation can often not be spotted until viewed in retrospect, because the  development of metrics and measures to value the innovation may have to be spurred by the innovation.

aV   5     1.2 Process Experience   I n  anticipation of the IEP designation   application ,  the University   created an Industry Task force   chaired  by  industry leaders 2   that   included   local  and global  industry   partners . 3   By July  2014,  the group submitted a  report of recommendations   to  the  P resident .   In   November 2014,  the  Vice President for Student Affairs   convened a Community E ngagement Working Group,   comprised  of  campus leaders with a stake in  community and  economic engagement ,  as a kick - off event for the  IEP   study ,   and identified   the  Office of  Entrepreneurship and   Innovative Partnerships   ( E&IP )   as the lead .    The  E&IP   office convened a working group including a graduate student from the Department of  Comparative Literature and ada pted the New Metrics and Assessment Tools to  Binghamton  The  Office of Institutional Research and Assessment (OIRA) provided  Binghamton    data . We  tested the survey with  our  senior officers   group  (S OG +) , senior research staff,  and undergraduates from our  Entrepreneurial Learning Community , and through multiple iterations, condensed  and  organized  the survey   into three categories:   Talent, Innovation, and Place.

Only Campus Leadership scored high in the area of industry partnerships   performance , an indicator  that we do not communicate this strength effectively. Effective communication arose continuously during all  interviews. Other areas identified for growth/improvement were: (a) meaningful, high - impact community -   and  industry - engaged activity  for all students; and, (b) growing an innovation ecosystem     corresponding and  building to our areas of accomplishments. All areas meet the educational goals for students and further our  commitment to the community.
p18
aV  At an open   forum  with  external stak eholders,  The Binghamton and Southern Tier NY Business  Community ,  a  discussion took place regarding the survey results and how to move forward in the region.
p19
aV We determined our areas of accomplishment and growth/improvement based on these interviews,  group dialogues, and the survey results,  along with institutional,  local ,   and state goals for our  area .  Campus  and community leaders agree that the physical growth  of our institution into the surrounding municipalities,  and  attracting  private investment to those areas ,   is an important indicator of our regional economic impact.   Per Stromhaug, Assistant  Vice President of I nnovation  and Economic  Development ,   discusses the study with the  Binghamton and Southern  Tier NY Business  Community , April 15, 2015.   
p20
aV   7     Each area for growth/improvement is  also  addressed in our strategic  Road Map   plan 4 ,   and t he CICEP  process  represents   a valuable step  toward   reaching our Road Map goals  of   apply ing   for the Carn egie  Classification  and join ing   the Association   of American Universities (AAU) .     1.3 The  Economic Engagement Enterprise     The institution has redefined its role in the community since 2002 . The enterprise involves particular,  localized initiatives  that  correspond with state - wide ec onomic revitalization goals purposefully connected to  its  SUNY  pu blic  network  of high education.  Our President , Harvey Stenger,  serves as co - chair of the  Southern  Tier  Regional Economic Development Council   ( REDC )   by appointment of the Governor; other   campus  leaders serve on local economic development boards.   SUNY2020   process has  helped fund  and implement our goals .  We have  expand ed   our outreach to  attract   a global student base.  The  visible   result of  these initiatives has been the   physical growth of our campus  amid   neighborhood revitalization efforts.    enterprise consists of industry partnerships ,   talent and workforce development , and  place deve lopment, with our reach concentrated locally, regionally, and state - wide,  and with   an  ever - increasing   impact nationally and globally.  We  seek to achieve econo mic prosperity  through   a three - dimensional impact  that employs our   strengths. Our professional schools in Nursing, Community and Public  Administration, Education, Engineering, and Business have long - standing, collaborative relationships  that  engage students in industry and the community, thereby assisting with industry g rowth and improving the  social and community infrastructure.

aV   8     Binghamton   defines economic engagement as the exchange of ideas, knowledge, expertise ,   talent,  and   physical resources between the institution and its stakeholders at a local   level and beyond   to  enrich involved  parties socially and economically.   Like the Carnegie, Kellogg, and AASCU definitions, economic engagement  is more than unilateral outreach or dissemination of knowledge, but rather collaborative, ongoing, and lasting  partnerships for mutual   benefit; like the Carnegie, engagement extends beyond the local as far as the global.
p23
aV Economic engagement is a central component of our Road Map   initiatives .  The President  adapted  this   concept   from  a   former institution,  Lehigh   University ,   when he ar rived in 2012 . In year  one, to  develop  strategic areas for becoming a premier public university,   5   the Road Map committees consisted of 400 people,  half of whom were community members. The institution considers this committee - driven Road Map process,  and a ccompanying set of metrics and institutional comparison groups,  a central   strength of its economic  engagement initiative.    Several offices across campus le ad  community  engagement efforts with  increasing intra - coordination,  including   the  Center for Civic Engagement   (CCE), the  Center of Excellence , the  Division of Advancement ,  and the  office of   Entrepreneurship and Innovative Partnerships   ( E&IP ).   W e continue to pursue the right  internal structure to improve our impact.    The region is beginning to understand and support the University as an anchor institution. Still, all  stakeholders voiced the need to better communicate our positive economic impact. The IEP process helped us   sion has changed and expanded.  S ome stakeholders already  understand the shift, particularly campus leadership and economic development leaders, many do not. We now

aV  1.4 Economic Engagement Planning     The institution   approaches economic engagement planning via the connected goals of becoming a  premier public institution  of the 21 st   century  and  being a main  regional  economic driver .  Strategic  planning  and goal setting occur through the Road Map ,  via state funding f or which SUNY campuses compete, and  REDC   funding for which the regions compete.   ur strategic plan (the Road  Map) helped us develop our vision that will guide us as we invest in new resources to improve the experiences
p26
aV Economic engagement planning involves building o n our growth; to that end, we  are constantly  seeking funding for capital investments in the community , with the goals of :   (1) grow ing   our  Incubator   in  downtown Binghamton (2016   opening ) into an  i nnovation  d istrict ;   (2)  grow ing   our  Pharmacy School   in  Johnson City ( 201 8   opening ) into a health sciences  campus   ( including moving the  Nursing School) ; and ,   (3)  grow ing   our  Center for Advanced Microelectronics Manufacturing   (CAMM) in Endicott into an  advanced   manufacturing hub servic ing   the Southern Tier. These plans will further institutional growth into   three  neighboring  municipalities and are represented in  the REDC led   applications for the  Upstate Revitalization  Fund   and  Consolidated Funding Application . We have based these growth goals on successes with the  University Downtown Center   campus, where the  College of Community and Public Administration   (CCPA) is  located and thrives in meeting its community - based mission.    
p27
aV To correspond with long - term plans for continued physical growth of campus, our strategic plans focus  on  student experien ces and industry relationships.   The  coming  Binghamton Plus   Master Program  will be  fo cused   on   high - impact student  engagement in  industry and   the   community , and will build on our  long - term  successes   in   Nursing, CCPA, and Engineering.  We will further grow student talent by  increasing   entrepreneur ial   coursework  and   support ,   leading to an entrepreneurship certificate .   Our research agenda remains focuse d   on growing  our research funding  and partnering with industry.  By supporting and growing student community and industry engagement and entrepreneurship, we believe we  can retain  more    to invigor ate economic prosperity , and Binghamton has taken a lead in these efforts.     1.5 Promotion and Communication     Through the IEP process,  we   learned the extent to which our internal and external stakeholders feel  that the major transitions underway  in   our economic engagement enterprise  must be better communicated.  Surveys showed that all stakeholders rated  economic initiatives  high  in importance, including   job creation,  internships, R&D funding, economic growth, and industry collaboration .   C ommunicating not only what  initiatives are underway, but also the importance  of   the  U niversity tak ing   the lead in growing economic  prosperity,   is central   for the success of our enterprise .
p28
aVWe have a strong communication foundation.  Our Office of Communic ations and Marketing  communicates daily with internal stakeholders through a daily online newsletter, a n   online newspaper, the  University website, and  Discovery - e ,   focused on campus insights and innovations .

aVWhen  IBM,  our largest local industry partner,  left in 2002,  we recognized the need to reinvent our  means of partnering with industry.  We lo oked to expand our industry relationships beyond  the   immediate  region.  To build loyal, long - term relationships, we established centers that require industry membership as a  means to grow and continue relationships. Due to their success, we have grown these   membership models   in  our  Small Scale Systems Integration and Packaging Center   (S 3 IP), now a New York State   Center of  Excellence, in which  m embers determine research   projects based on their needs .     There are  six   centers  and one  lab  within S 3 IP :  IEEC ,  ADL ,  ES2 ,  NLAB,   CAMM ,  CASP   and  NECCES .     We engage with industry in  additional  ways   through our schools .

Broome County  experienced a devastating flood in 2011 after tropical storms  hit our   area. The  Center for Civic Engagement   coordinated an effort to help students and community members  that were  forced to leave their homes. The  campus opened two shelters: general population (GP) and functional   medical needs (FMN) (we opened both  types of shelters  for the  first time  in 2006 in response to flooding). For our region, the FMN shelter required  full - time medical assistance, above and beyond what is typically intended for this type of shelter.  The  nursing  students were instrumental in providing necessary nursing care.

The region predicts that health care occupa tions will  encompass three - fifths of future high need job categories due to the growing geriatric population. 12     At a March meeting of the Institute for Intergenerational Aging, attended by faculty, students, and  health care practitioners, Dean of the Pharm acy School Gloria Meredith emphasized the partnership  possibilities for this school and the need for inter - professional education to produce team - ready pharmacists, a   - d isciplinary  collaborations form the core goal of the health sciences campus, with doctors, nurses, and related providers  taking a team approach to medicine and sharing simulation and telemedicine labs. The Southern Tier Health  Sciences  program  will encompass  team learning by moving the Decker School of Nursing (now on the main   Hospital, and engaging the SUNY Upstate Medical University campus (n ow in east Binghamton). Expanded  training will be offered through already established initiatives such as the  Decker School of Nursing  Memory  Clinic (over 800 clients served since 1988), which provides diagnostic and case management services for  individual  initiatives including Applied Learning, Start - Up NY, and  Open SUNY   (extending critical health care training  to stu dents across NYS).    Another key factor to growing the campus and an innovation district is the support of entrepreneurship  at all levels, including educational programming as well as funding.    Increased focus on entrepreneurship as  part of the undergradu ate and graduate education, the B - Innovative student incubator, hackathons, a mentor  and expert network, and access to proof - of concept funding for student and faculty entrepreneurs, will lead to  a pipeline of new ventures that initially will utilize the S tart - Up Suite Pre - Incubator on campus.

aV    12   Steering Committee   will develop   recommendations on how to improve  coordination,  communication   and  responsiveness to  internal and external   needs.  Clemson  has   historically   demonstrated its commitment to  allocate  appropriate resources to support the   economic engagement enterprise,  including recurring funding for key areas  of engagement (the  O ffice of  E conomic  D evelopment,  PSA,  experiential learning programs, outreach  efforts , etc.) .     E.  Promotion and Communication.     ,  we   gained valuable information a bout key stakeholder groups .   Externally, industry  partner  response was significant . F ewer responses from community  stakeholder s   may  indicate   a need for   more  effective communication   related to community - based  economic engagement .    I ntern ally, we need to better   connect our faculty, staff and students with our land grant  and economic development  mission s .  Some f aculty and   -   particularly  those   in  colleges   not involved in   larger scale  industry cluster partnerships .  These communication concerns are addressed in  our grow th and im provement plan and play   a key role in guiding  the development of  our  future  strateg y.   Clemson will  develop  an   effective communication strategy centered  on   our  role in  economic engagement.  We intend   to  build   connections  and  expand economic engagement  relationships   among internal and external  groups .   A need  exists to   communicate the value of   community partnerships , particularly   related to     and indirect  economic activities   that have  social and cultural  community  impact  but perhaps  have bee n  overlooked for their  economic value .     F.  Advancing University Economic Engagement.     Clemson demonstrates strong institutional leadership for  innovation and  economic engagement.   R ecently, Clemson was  one of   twelve   universities   recognized as a  national best practice   for  economic development   in  Innovation 2.0 .   13     Clemson was noted for   public - private partnerships   with targeted industries   that   leverage  regional talent and drive economic opportunity.

aVIII. Growth/Improvement Plan     (Word Count: 1947/2000)   Internal and external s takeholders identified weaknesses in the areas   of access and coordination,  communication, and responsiveness .  As Clemson   develops more collaborative partnerships , it will by necessity  require  more effective coordination of entities, easier access to facilities and expertise, and greater responsivenes s  to community and  external partner  needs. Addressing these weaknesses effectively will be critical for sustaining  existing partnerships and creating new ones.   Area 1: Access   and Coordination   Internal respo nses to access and coor dination .  Feedba ck from faculty focus groups and staff, community  and industry  surveys revealed that  Clemson could be doing significantly more to coordinate the economic  engagement enterprise  as a whole . The lowest performing  categori es internally  dealt wi th access and coordination :    enga g ing   faculty and staff regarding opportunities and  benefits related to participation in regional economi c  development activities ;  h aving a designated  entry point   for  industry an d economic development agencies,  and   maintaining user friendly portals and websites to search for  faculty and staff expertise  and R&D facilities .

aVare very well coordinated. It does not always  seem that there is full knowledge across campus  and in the region of all [activities] that different  departments are engaged in. I am not certain  there is any one office on campus t hat knows all  of the outreach, all of the partnerships to the  point that we are not possibly duplicating effort.
p259
aV    23   Further, survey responses and faculty feedback indicated   that many   feel that important social, cult ural or  talent contributions are sometimes  overlooked when discussing   economic impact/economic development. 32   M any  faculty, staff and students are involved in critical work that enhances quality of life in  SC , with significant  community  impacts in areas like public health,  literacy initiatives,  education, and nursing.  Further, faculty who   w ant to be more engaged feel   that  there are not structural rewards for   economic engagement, with such activities   not  being tangibly  rewarded  through   the promotion and tenure proce ss . 33   Feedback from this process  shed s   light  on the inherent economic value of the core learning, discovery, and engagement missions of our institution across  disciplines and challenge s   us to consider how to better coordinate  and communicate  economic engagement  activities   across disciplin es .    External responses to access and coordination .   performance lowest in the  areas of   providing a single designated p oint of contact    (with a score of 3.0 from  commun ity, 3.3 from industry ) 34   and  providing  user - friendly portals and websites (with a score of 3.57 from  commun ity and 3.65 from industry). While  industry and community partners provided positive feedback over all,  we   found it significant that  access and coordination   surfaced  as one of the lowest a reas of performance  across  both our internal and external stakeholder groups.     A survey conducted by PSA of their external stakeholders in  2013 - 14 also recommended that Clemson provide assistance to local county councils in understanding other  Clemson Un iv ersity resources  available to them related to workforce and business development. 35

aVArea 2: Communication     Internal.    Large portions of the Clemson   community,  especially staff, indicated   they   are not aware of how    economic engagement enterprise. 37   Survey and focus group   feedback indicate work  needs  to be done to  communicate  the broader concept of   economic engagemen t   and involve more  faculty and staff, and students.     External.   Industry respondents indicated that Clemson could improve at reporting the impact of its  contributions to regional innovation and economic growth to local and regional stake holders (with a  rating of 3.61)  and   actively engaging senior campus leadership in regional economic growth initiatives (with a score of 3.57) .    Plans for Improvement.     The Office of Economic D evelopment, with guidance from the steering  committee,  will   develop a communicat ions strategy  regardin g Clemson economic engagement.  This strategy will  address the   university - wide need to d    economic engagement enterprise -   including  an inventory  of  the engagement  initiatives  currently   taking place in each college and among off campus

aV36   Examples of this feedback include: (1) Provide more workshops/training sessions for interested faculty/staff in facilitating  engagement and  collaboration in economic partnerships and programs, particularly at the local and regional levels; (2) Have an off ice or coordinated group on  campus that is familiar with all expertise across the University in order to effectively and efficiently make connections for   industry;  (3) Provide  a central portal/office/group for industry to connect into the university;   (4)  Integrate/engage colleges and departments that have not  historically played much of a role in economic development.   37    of what  Clems on is doing in the spheres of econom

aVaddressing   community and industry   needs .  Community   respondents indicated that Clemson could do a better job of facilitating respectful civic discourse and  contributing to community  understanding of complex issues (with a performance score of 3.5) .  Economic  opportunity is affected by myriad factors, including race, gender, language and cultural barriers for new  Americans, geographic/logistical access to communities,  and  issu es unique  to rural communities. Clemson can   serve as a bridge   to communicate and address these complex realities  and serve   as a facilitator of civi c   engagement  and growth in  SC .    I ndustry  responses   indicated that Clemson could do more to provide flexible  course offe rings  (with a performance score of 3.53) .
p269
aV Ironically  can be impacted greatly by our  ability  to be responsive . For example,  Clemson  - private partnerships stems from the ability to listen and  respond to emerging industry needs;  however, as  partnerships increase,   respo nsiveness could be negatively  impacted.   strength in  experiential learning suggests that we have been able to res pond to changing  needs in higher education. Over the last five years, we have seen a rapid growth in online, flexible learning in  higher education 38   and it should not be surprising that external stakeholders have an expectation that Clemson will  not only ke ep pace with this trend toward flexibility, but will be a leader in other  emerging  areas   related to  instructional strategies.   According to  Clemson  IPEDS data   for Fall 2013,  84   % of Clemson undergraduates were   not enrolled in any   form of distance education a nd 90% of graduate students were  not enrolled in any  online  or distance  learning . 39

aVIV.  Conclusion   Clemson is at  a juncture  of tremendous change. We are   moving   into a period of  growth   that  has the  potential to  further  distinguish   our institution as a visionary leader in higher education. While we have many  accomplishments to celebrate as a top 20   national   public university, the   very strengths and weaknesses identified  by our stakeholders in this self - study reveal the pitfalls of achievement:  our weaknesses are  largely   the outcomes  of rapid growth in our strengths. For example, our nationally recognized public - private partnership   models have  driven an increased interest in our institution from external partners, but the university has not designated a single  point of entry for such partnerships or a referral system that keeps track of such interest, whether it be from a  company, a   non profit organization, a government affiliated entity, or some other entity or individual.   This   on of excellence in partnership. W e are now challenged to build the  infrastructure necessary to meet that growt h. Likewise, o ur stakeholders want to know more about the work we  are doing -   and they  want to hear it directly from us . This is a great indicator that they are invested in our outcomes  and want to be engaged with our successes. Our industry partners  indica te  a desire to turn to Clemson as a   primary resource for flexible courses for continuing educat ion .  In many ways, these are very good problems -   they  are born out of successes in uncharted territory . If we respond to them proactively, with a vision for the   continued  improvement of our University, we will build on the tremendous achievements of the past while embracing the  change necessary to  push forward as an insightful, innovative institution of   the future.

ECU  is   mission driven to maximize student success,  serve the public, and lead regional transformation. This application details     regional transformation  process, accomplishments, and strategies for future growth  in eastern North Carolina. Keys to success lie in retaining regional talent and  identifying new opportunities that mutually benefit the university and  its   partners.     ECU   is  an economic  hub  that  spu rs   urban revitalization  while radiating   rural  development.  T here is  a  focus on economic development in Greenville and Pitt  County, where t he university is located ,   and   tight connection s   between the campus  and larger  region .  ECU  is  assisting   an area historically dependent on fishing,  farming, and forestry  in its diversification to include   manufacturing, human health,  tourism, and the military (Figure 1) ,  and retaining regional talent is critical to the  transition.

aVprimary 40 county region of impact includes 26 counties designated Tier 1,  the most  economically  distressed, by the North Carolina Department of  Commerce.   Like talent,  we   see innovation as key to  driving  economic prosperity  a nd ensuring beneficial  regional transformation.     ECU define s   innovation as breakthrough thinking  resulting   in advancement of new  knowledge, technologies, and products to solve significant societal problems.  Economic  p rosperity is an  outcome of community - campus partnership s   creating   a  more competitive region and healthy communities that attain economic,  educational, environmental, cultural, and e ntrepreneurial goals .   These definitions  lie at the heart of  DRIVE  East,  our   inn ovation and  economic   prosperity   campaign .

aV   A.2.  Process Experience   In  F all 2013 a team of administrators and faculty involved in economic and  community development met to discuss applying for the  APLU   Innovation and  Economic Prosperity (IEP) designation.  The Offices of Innovation and Economic  Development (OIED) and Public Service and Community Relations (PSCR) are  key contact points for the university and were instrumental in identifying  IEP  stakeholde rs . B usiness and industry partners, local government   staff , elected  officials, statewide association representatives, and leaders of community and  regional development organizations   were involved .
p300
aV T he 2013 - 14 (hereafter 2014) IEP  application   data  were   co llected via   interviews,  focus groups, and surveys using   CICEP - Assessment Tools .  Though  ECU  did   not  successful ly gain  the IEP designation in the first attempt, the 2014 process and  reviewer comments  have been   invaluable guides for refining  DRIVE  East . This  reapplication reflects the lessons learned and  new strategies for   innovation and  economic prosperity .     In the summer of 2014, Chancellor Steve Ballard appointed a team (Table 1) to  examine   university outreach and engagement activities.  His  instructions were to : 1)   analyze strengths and weaknesses identified from the 2014 IEP ; 2) analyze  stakeholder data; and, 3)  refine our strategies for collaborative regional outreach,  community  engagement, and economic development.

Members were chosen  for their involvement in outreach and engagement activities and represented a wide   staff, and faculty from each college.

aVTask Force subcommittees org anized around the CICEP domains were created.  Subcommittees were formed to improve alignment of economic engagement  activities with the university strategic plan and develop a comprehensive branding  strategy to promote (internally and externally) economic  engagement and public  service initiatives. Monthly subcommittee meetings focused on enhancing  innovation and economic prosperity initiatives to establish ECU as a national  leader in  regional   transformation.

aV    8   The IEP  Steering Committee   focused on  results from  CICEP Assessment Tool  surveys  identified  common challenges that might impede economic transformation   ( see Appendix  A   for results) .  These challenges  became areas of focus for the Task  Force , which was guided by four critical  questions .     1.   What does regional transformation mean for the University?   2.   What economic development and engagement activities are ECU doing  well?   3.   What improvements can be made to the process of engagement, innovation,  and economic development?   4.   How can stakeho lders be engaged fully?     ECU and its partners  established four goals for  DRIVE  East   to : 1) establish ECU  as a national model for rural development and regional transformation; 2) build a  comprehensive engagement and economic development enterprise that res ponds to  regional needs   and   connects faculty, staff, and students to community partner  organizations; 3) create a  research   and innovation campus that fuels development ;  and, 4) generate technologies and solutions   that contribute to regional clusters  around  e STEAM ( entrepreneurship,  science, technology, engineering, art/design  and mathematics),  with initial emphasis upon  pharmaceutical s   and other forms of  manufacturing,  the  military, health care,   and coastal  issues , as well as  entrepreneurship throughout the region.     The process of identifying accomplishments  began during   the  2014 IEP process  and continued with collecting data to support the 2014  submission to be re - designated a  Carnegie Community Engagement  campus .  T hese   d ata   suggest  commonalities that  establish a   baseline  of shared vision and goals   (Figure  3 ) across  partners inside and outside the University.
p321
aV Data gathered during  both   process es   were supplemented with an inventory of grant  funded projects and interviews with ECU faculty and staff who are active in  community and econ omic development (see Appendix B ).     Our growth and improvement plan is based on identified gaps between resources  an d need s   as perceived by stakeholders.  Stakeholders agreed that ECU should  enhance community engagement and economic development  in a number of   ways  ( See  Figure  4 ).
p322
aV   A.4 Economic Engagement Planning   The history of a formal structure for ECU economic engagement dates to 1964  when the Regional Development Institute (RDI) was created to provide economic  and community development services and conduct applied The RDI was later  reorganized and  bec a me   the  OI ED , located in the Division of Research and  Graduate Studies.   Today the office of PSCR, w  ,   and  the Volunteer and Service Learning Center (VSLC ) , within the  Division of Student  Affairs , also significantly contribute to the   engagement .
p323
aVThese offices serve as a bridge between resources of the university and the region,  state, and beyond. OIED partners with education, industry, government, military  and community partners to provide 1)   community development and regional  leadership; 2) cluster - based economic development; and, 3) innovation,  entrepreneurship and small business support.   PSCR is responsible for strategic  planning, coordination, and assessment of public service  data   for the  university,  development of  human capital for  community engaged scholarship, and  building  community partnerships . VSLC, in partnership with local, regional, and  international communities, fosters learning, take s   action through service, and

aVThe Task Force created definitions that articulate a vision of economic engagement  that ECU shares with its partners and  that is   represented by the ECU Regional  Transformation Model ( see  Figure  5 ).     Figure  5 :  ECU Regional  Transformation Model (RTM)

aV  - 2019 strategic plan  is  organized around commitments   to : (1)  maximize student success, (2) serve the public, and (3) lead regional  transformation. In  the RTM ,   innovation is an accelerator  between these  commitments   and regional transformation   ( see  Figure 6) .

aV The success of our students is the ultimate measure of  how well  ECU   meets its  mission .  For example,  ECU created a pipeline fr om classroom to workplace called  the  Early College Second Life Program   (ECSLP) .  The immersive and creative  nature of the Second Life platform (a 3 - D virtual world) provides  efficient  instructional delivery .  Students in North Carolina high schools remain in   their  physical high school location while ECU delivers instruction through Second Life .  The immersive experience allows instructors to create and deliver content that  engages   students  in   interactive  assignments .  In collaboration with North Carolina  New Sc hools, the program currently (spring, 2015) provides instruction to over  520 students in 18 high schools in 11 rural North Carolina school districts .  Students are selected for participation by the local high school and represent first - generation college st udents, students at risk for dropping out of school, and  underrepresented populations.     A.5  Promotion and Communication   Our current target audiences  include  (but are not limited to) , community based  organizations, economic development commissions, government,  military,  universities in the UNC system, elected officials, and alumni. Our intentional  placement of stories using a combination of mediums such as news media and  social media  promotes our engagement story to these audiences .     The goal of our communication strategy is to engage our internal and external  stakeholders in an intentional two - way interaction. Our communication strategy  involves promoting stories to our target audienc e, but also acquiring stories from  them .

aV    13   ECU uses internal media services ( ECU Today ,  ECU Now Blog ,  East Ma gazine ,  The East Carolinian ) to promote our engagement story.  First Monday   is a monthly  newsletter by Provost Ron Mitche lson, which highlights stories on student success,  public service, and regional transformation. Our internal news services maintain an  open line of communication with local, regional, and state news services, in  particular The Greenville Daily Reflector an d WITN News Channel 7, which focus  on telling our story to external stakeholders.     To maintain  this   two - way interaction with stakeholders, ECU has taken steps to  open the lines of communication to engage with our community rather than simply  promoting our  assets   to them. Our social media platforms at the university level  and at the unit level   Twitter ,  Facebook ,  YouTube  create opportunities for both our internal and external audiences to  communicate with us. We encourage stakeholders to submit their success stories at  all levels of the university; in particular, the  P SCR office   has implemented a  Story  Pipeline   to collect these success stories, which are then distributed to the  appropriate news service for publication.     A.6  Advancing University Engageme nt   East Carolina University has a strong history of service and regional engagement  and is committed to building on that legacy to become a national model for  regional transformation and rural development .  ECU used our   IEP and Strategic  Planning processes  as opportunities to engage our faculty, staff and students and  receive valuable input from our external partners .  This input has been a guide for  our internal assessment and has allowed the University to build a comprehensive ,  intentional   and connected app roach to engaging with our region, collectively  marketing campus resources, and building innov ative public/private  partnerships .

aV   North Carolina is the fourth largest manufacturing state in the country. This sector  is changing rapidly with companies developing and adopting new technologies to  coll aborate with others, fuel innovation and design the best products possible. In  North Carolina, advanced manufacturers rely heavily on skilled STEM (Science,  Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) workers and STEM jobs are expected  to grow by 17 percent b etween 2008 and 2018 with 91 percent of STEM jobs  requiring post - secondary education by 2018.  T hese employers face a shortage of  candidates to fill current job openings.

Longer term, ECU is engaged with regional parents, students, educators, and  employers to build clearer pathways connecting education with employment and  entrepreneurial opportunities .  Through the Advanced Manufactur ing and  Innovation Academy,  ECU is aggressively preparing   e STEAM ( Entrepreneurship,  Science, Technology, Engineering, Art/Design, and Mathematics) graduates with  the skills, knowledge and abilities to innovatively solve real - world problems .  These graduates   are in high demand by regional employers and also help attrac t  new employers to the region.

Together, ECU, Vidant and the VAMC offer significant  opportunities for patient - centered clinical research, discovery and innovation with  industry, government, military and community partners.   We offer two examples of  our reach from campus to com munity.     School of Dental Medicine Community Service Learning Centers   NC   is currently ranked 47th out of the 50 states in terms of access to dental care.  Three counties in the state  Tyrell, Camden, and Hyde  have no dental practices  at all. The average number of dentists per 10,000 in population in the CSLC  counties is less tha n half the number of dentists in the three largest counties in NC.  There are more dentists per residents in counties along the economic corridor  between Raleigh and Charlotte (see green line in Figure 9).  With a combination of  an aging dental workforce and   an unequal distribution between urban and rural  dental care across the state, the SODM focus is on training dentists who are able to  treat a wide variety of patients, particularly patients with complex health needs  who have been unable to receive oral hea lth care in the past.   During their fourth  year at ECU,  dental  students complete three eight - week clinical rotations at  CSLCs.

aV    2 3   Seven of 10 planned CSLCs are open, serving   patients from 37 NC counties.  T he  eighth   center  will  open in the summer of 2015 in Brunswick County ( see Figure 9 ).   The Centers connect the oral health care needed in rural communities with dental  student learning experiences.  Students and dental school faculty staff community  clinics a nd consult with other faculty experts located at the SoDM in Greenville via  teleconference for real - time patient care.  This strategy results in culturally  competent and technically skilled dentists who are reflective of the diversity of the  state   and the u se of technology for delivering state of the art patient care .   It is  another example of how ECU acts as a hub for innovation across the state.     Operational Reentry North Carolina   Operation   Reentry North Carolina (ORNC),  is  a  DoD - funded   national research  support organization serving military personnel, veterans and their families,  develops unique university - military partnerships. ORNC focuses on critical gaps in  resilience, rehabilitation and reintegration of service - members, veterans and their  families, a s well as the challenges facing the DoD and VA health providers who  care for them.   ORNC continues to grow its  funding  portfolio including  sources   such as the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and  private foundations. These non - DoD f unding sources are converting ORNC  research into services culminating in a community - based model of veteran and  family wellness and reintegration, which retains this talented workforce in North  Carolina. Innovative approaches and services include;  Wounded  Warrior Kids  Innovation Camp, Laboratory for Simulated Blast Injury and High Explosive   Rover and Tools for Advanced Manufacturing for Veterans .  Each of these  enterprises creates new   education, research and outreach opportunities for this  critically important  regional  population.     B. 4.

aV Workers in STEM fields play a direct role in driving economic growth. Yet ,  because of how the STEM economy has been defined, policymakers have mainly  focused on supporting workers with at least an undergraduate degree, overlooking  a strong potential workforce of those with a high school diploma, associate degree  and/or stackabl e certifications and credentials. Additionally, education policy  makers and employers recognize now that while STEM is a necessary driver of a  competitive workforce and economy, this alone is not sufficient to build an  economy that continually generates mo re ideas to solve more and bigger problems,  i.e. an innovation economy.

C. 3.  Regional Transformation Council (RTC)   The Task Force recommended that ECU create a portal,  REACHECU , for   engagement in community and regional development activities. The aim is to show  alignment and coordination of university initiatives so that there is institutional  cohesi on around engagement and economic development and to embed these  activities in work across colleges and disciplines. The development of the portal  cannot be complete until the completion of the organizational structural review of  PSCR and  alignment with  OI ED. That review will take place during the 2015  summer.     Improved communication between ECU and its stakeholders is intended to yield  centers of excellence, like the Pharmaceutical Development and Manufacturing  Center of Excellence and the NC Agromedicine  Institute.

aVAssociation of Public and Land -grant Universities  Innovation and Economic Prosperity  University  Award Program   PROJECT  NARRATIVE   FRESNO  STATE  August 2013   INTRODUCTION  California State University, Fresno \ufb01powers the New California\ufb02 through learning, schol arship, and  engagement. The San Joaquin Valley is  the \ufb01New California \ufb02 and the greatest agricultural region in the  world in terms of farm gate, diversity of crop, and production. On the other side of the spectrum, it has  some of the toughest social and eco nomic issues as well: persistent problems of poverty, environmental   degradation, and social separation, as evidenced by consistent underperformance compared to other   regions in California and the nation.    As stated in the University Strategic Plan 2011 -15, \ufb01the future of this region, which we call the \u201aNew  California,\u2122 is dependent upon increasing the educational level of the population and developing an   innovative culture led by social entrepreneurs committed to the stewardship of the region, its resources , and the people who live in this place. It is a daunting challenge; and Fresno State must play a major role  in meeting it, by working collaboratively toward an alignment of major institutions and citizen leaders  who are committed to transformation.\ufb02   The  University, which has been the primary leader in networked innovation, produces connectivity,   collaboration and advocacy for the Valley with the goal of economic and social prosperity. Office of   Community and Economic Development (OCED), Lyles Center for I nnovation and Entrepreneurship  (Lyles Center), and the Jan and Bud Richter Center for Community Engagement and Service Learning are  
p389
aVAPLU  AWARD APPLICATION, A UGUST 2013 | PROJECT  NARRATIVE  FRESNO STATE  | OCED  three prime examples of the University\u2122s commitment to the region. For the purpose of this application,  we have chosen to co ncentrate on OCED and its regional initiatives; California Partnership for the San  Joaquin Valley (Partnership), San Joaquin Valley Rural Development Center ( SJV RDC), San Joaquin  Valley Broadband Consortium (SJVRBC), San Joaquin Valley  Housing Collaborati ve (SJVHC), and the  Community and Regional Planning Center (CPRC).   AWARD  APPLICATION  PROCESS  As the University\u2122s point of contact to the community, OCED was assigned the responsibility of  participating in the award application process. Mike Dozier , OCED e xecutive  director , was the primary  point of contact with Ismael Herrera, Rural Development Director, and Melanie Allen, Administrative  Assistant, as the two alternates. OCED participated in every conference call and attended the summer  meeting in Charlotte sville, Va., in June.     To gauge the University\u2122s effectiveness and perception in the region, OCED incorporated the APLU  Institutional Self -Assessment Tool to Enhance Regional Innovation and Prosperity. Personalized emails  with the Assessment Survey attach ed were sent to 1,000 regional leaders. The response rate was 12%, or  121 completed surveys. Respondents included: Department heads (47%), Presidents/CEOs (29.8%),   elected officials (3.3%), and staff (2.5%), and represented government (37.5%), business (25 .8%),  nonprofit (15%), community agencies (10%), and education (9.2%). In addition to the survey, OCED  engaged stakeholders through the San Joaquin Valley Regional Economic Forum which is more fully  described in the case study.   Survey responders gave the  University high marks for its contribution to the economic growth of the   region (72% good or excellent ratings) but were somewhat confused as to how the University\u2122s expertise   could be accessed. The good news is the respondents seemed to understand the con tributions and  
p390
aVAPLU  AWARD APPLICATION, A UGUST 2013 | PROJECT  NARRATIVE  FRESNO STATE  | OCED  collaboration that the University provides for regional innovation and economic growth initiatives.  Dissemination of information about university/community collaborations also was an appreciated activity.   THE  ECONOMIC  ENGAGEMENT  ENTERPRISE  As specified in the University Mission Statement, \ufb01The University faculty, staff, and administrators work  together to: Make student success our first priority; Embrace a culture of diversity, internationalization,  and inclusion; Advance our established dis tinction in liberal arts and sciences, professional programs, and   community engagement ; Produce transformative scholarly research and creative works that target  regional issues with global significance; Exemplify the ethical stewardship of capital and huma n resources; and  Develop institutional, community, and intellectual leaders.\ufb02  President John Welty has  stressed community engagement to faculty and staff as well as to the community for the past 21 years. He   has been the guiding light for community engagem ent in heading numerous community committees and  boards, and establishing on -campus offices, departments and centers focused on engagement. This  application does not allow for a thorough description of all of these efforts.   Fresno State fully embraces and  implements the Carnegie Community Engagement Classification. As is  demonstrated in the case studies provided in this application, Fresno State is extensively engaged in the  region and collaborates on a continual basis with local, regional, state and natio nal community leaders.  The establishment and administration of the California Partnership for the San Joaquin Valley is a shining  example of the University\u2122s commitment to community engagement as defined by Carnegie.   The Partnership was established in 200 5 with an Executive Order by Governor Schwarzenegger and  subsequently renewed in 2010. Fresno State was instrumental in creating the Partnership; OCED was   appointed as the Secretariat. The Partnership brought together experts and leaders committed to   susta inable economic development, environmental stewardship and human advocacy. The Partnership is  
p391
aVAPLU  AWARD APPLICATION, A UGUST 2013 | PROJECT  NARRATIVE  FRESNO STATE  | OCED  the most comprehensive organization of civic leadership in the history of the Valley. Thousands of  concerned stakeholders from business and industry, government,  nonprofit and community sectors have  been involved in this effort. For the first time, public and private sectors from all eight counties are  working together to find and implement solutions that will improve the quality of life for Valley residents  The ma ke-up of the 44 -member Partnership Board reflects this diverse group and includes the following  representatives: 8 State of California Cabinet Secretaries, 8 elected officials (one from each county), 8   private sector (one from each county), 5 liaison, 12 c onsortia agencies, and 3 specialty expertise.   ECONOMIC  ENGAGEMENT  PLANNING  Survey results identified areas that need the most improvement as: how the University communicates its  contributions, successes and achievements which benefit the region; how well  the University links its  resources and expertise to public needs; and, how well the University creates educational and professional   development opportunities that are relevant to regional economic growth and innovation. Disconnections   in these areas might  be due in part to infrastructure, culture and communication weaknesses. Fresno State   understands its role in the community and is continually evolving ways to address the weaknesses  identified in the survey.    While communication appears to be the largest  challenge, it is not as much an obstacle as an opportunity.  Efforts are already under way to address the issue including adoption of a communications plan for   community engagement through OCED. Engagement activities are best communicated through outreach  and speaking opportunities as well as by explaining and highlighting activities and successes in  newsletters. However, the best and most time -intensive form of communications is one -on-one or through  partnership development. When the university has entered  into partnerships, there have been positive  results with long -lasting feelings of mutual respect and willingness to partner in the future. OCED has  been designated by the President as the point of contact for community access to the campus. Such access  wil l be one area of focus for improvement in the coming year.   
p392
aVAPLU  AWARD APPLICATION, A UGUST 2013 | PROJECT  NARRATIVE  FRESNO STATE  | OCED   In addressing regional innovative and economic growth concerns expressed by respondents, there are  several initiatives planned. The Lyles Center is expanding its technology transfer/commercializa tion  efforts and has hired a program manager who will work to assist both on -campus faculty and community  entrepreneurs to commercialize their ideas. The Fresno State Foundation is helping commercialization  opportunities by creating New California Ventures , LLC., an essential funding source for Valley  Entrepreneurs and Fresno State faculty researchers.    Education and professional development are being addressed by the creation of cohorts for Sustainable  Planning and Water Technology. Both are extremely rel evant and needed in the Valley. Additionally, a  cohort to address the future high -speed rail construction, scheduled to start in the Valley in 2014, is in the  planning stages. Linking all of this together is the Regional Industry Clusters Initiative (RICI) . RICI is an  aggressive, proactive initiative created and administered by OCED for a collaboration of economic and  workforce development providers, such as higher education, workforce agencies, government and  professional organizations, with the intent of  engaging the private sector to address the needs for greater  success in the Valley. RICI efforts already have created a network of organizations ready to move   forward with private sector engagement.   PROMOTION AND  COMMUNICATIONS  With respect to economic en gagement, the University has a broad and diverse constituency, and  communication is a challenge. The  8-county, 62 -city San Joaquin Valley region has a population (4  million) larger than 23 states and a land mass larger than 10 states. The region is demogra phically diverse  and, according to Congressional Research Service, is one of the most economically depressed regions in   the country. The issues are so pervasive and inter -connected that the University connects and collaborates  with stakeholders and leaders  in all of the following areas:  Advanced Communications Services   (Broadband); Air Quality; Economic Development; Energy; Health and Wellness; Higher Education and  
p393
aVAPLU  AWARD APPLICATION, A UGUST 2013 | PROJECT  NARRATIVE  FRESNO STATE  | OCED  Workforce Development; Sustainable Planning; PreK -12 Education, Housing; Water Quality, Supp ly and  Reliability. Survey conclusions indicate that the outcome of communications efforts needs improvement.   Fresno State adopted a new communications plan in 2012 with a new logo and the brand of \ufb01Discovery.  Diversity. Distinction.\ufb02  Similarly, OCED cre ated a communications plan in 2013 for engagement of all  of the stakeholders and leaders identified above. One of the biggest communications issues is making the   subject matter consistent and easy to understand by a wide range of stakeholders. Once the com munity  understands the benefits of inclusion, communication becomes easier. Therefore, a new brand and  elevator pitch were developed for each of the regional initiatives. Examples of these brands are as  follows:  Partnership - \ufb01Connect. Collaborate. Advocate \ufb02;  Rural Development Center - \ufb01Let\u2122s build  thriving rural communities\ufb02;  Regional Industry Clusters Initiative - \ufb01Maximizing the region\u2122s  competitive advantage\ufb02;  Housing Collaborative - \ufb01Identifying comprehensive solutions for the region\u2122s  housing challenges\ufb02;  Regional Broadband Consortium - \ufb01Closing the digital divide\ufb02;  and  Smart  Valley Places - \ufb01Collaborating for a sustainable San Joaquin Valley.\ufb02   For the coming year, OCED will be exercising the communications plan through several projects. First,   launch a ne w website for each initiative , with a mixture of concise description and more detailed reports  and articles as attachments. All sites will link together as well as to the University website for a clear   explanation of how it all connects. Second, conduct or  sponsor regional events such as: the San Joaquin  Regional Economic Forum (see case study); RICI industrial events with business; Central Valley Venture   Forum (see case study); Small Business Development Center events; and quarte rly Partnership Board   meeti ngs.  Third, leading grant applications with partners that meet the goals and objectives of the  University and OCED, and providing opportunities that enhance the economic prosperity of the region.   Fourth, developing and distributing newsletters to all Valle y stakeholders and leaders, communicating  activities, opportunities and success stories. Finally, providing interviews with print and electronic media  and making presentations throughout the Valley, as requested.

aVAPLU  AWARD APPLICATION, A UGUST 2013 | PROJECT  NARRATIVE  FRESNO STATE  | OCED  ADVANCING  UNIVERSITY  ECONOMIC  ENGAGEMENT  It is not an exaggeration or hyperbole to say that Fresno State is the Valley leader for economic  engagement and innovation. The University is seen as an objective convener, which allows for crossing  professional and political boundaries and knocking down si los. Other agencies and organizations are  focused on a single subject, which confines them within their professional silo. Others are responsible  primarily or exclusively to a city or county, which does not allow them to lead on a regional basis. Fresno   State has no such boundary. In addition, the University has accepted the role of innovative leader for the  benefit of the entire region.    Current examples of the University as a regional economic engagement leader:   California Partnership for the San Joaquin  Valley . See above.   Smart Valley Places . Stemming from a $4 million HUD Sustainability grant,  this initiative  includes 14 Valley cities with 50,000 population or greater, 4 Community Based Organizations,  led by Fresno State, collaborating to develop susta inable planning practices for Valley cities of all  sizes. The tool kit from this initiative will be combined with the Blueprint for the San Joaquin  Valley and used by the Community and Regional Planning Center for future use. The partnership  will be on goi ng.   San Joaquin Valley Regional Broadband Consortium .  Brings together public and private sector  information technology professionals in the eight counties to: encourage expansion of broadband   infrastructure to 95 percent of Valley homes by 2015; provide d igital literacy training; and  promote telehealth and telemedicine throughout the Valley.

On-campus partnership between OCED and  the College of Social Science , to provide planning technical  assistance for Valley cities and  counties. CPRC also is a clearinghouse and repository for planning documents and tools to be  accessed by the Valley.    While Fresno State takes a leadership position in the region, it does so without entitlement and ego, an d with a great deal of inclusiveness. Its leadership is based on abundance for all; not a \ufb01zero sum gain.\ufb02 We  encourage participation and leadership from Valley schools of higher education. There exists a great   partnership with Community Colleges and trade  schools. University of California, Merced  - the newest  UC campus  - is emerging as a leader and partner with Fresno State on several fronts. California State  University, Bakersfield and California State University, Stanislaus also are beginning to get invo lved in  community engagement. There is much more to accomplish than one University can do on its own.   Fresno State is proud to provide encouragement and mentorship to other Universities in advancing  economic engagement. Fresno State, in partnership with C alifornia State University, Chico, was  designated a \ufb01University Center\ufb02 by the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA). Two   universities partnering on a single application is highly unusual and very innovative. Rather than compete  against each other , the universities partnered on the application and the deliverable goals and objectives.  Combining the strengths of both universities proves to be highly beneficial to each university and the  regions they serve.     On the national level, Fresno State also  plays a role in advancing economic engagement. President John  Welty was awarded Outstanding Institutional Leader by International Economic Development Council  (IEDC) for his leadership in guiding Fresno State in economic engagement. He has been a speaker o n local, state and national stages, discussing the model and the benefits of engagement. Fresno State  Provost William Covino has won the 2013 William M. Plater Award for Leadership in Civic

aV CASE STUDY:  San Joaquin Valley  Regional Economic Forum   OVERVIEW  The  Office of Community and Economic Development  at Fresno State  (OCED)  held  the  San Joaquin  Valley  Regional Economic Forum  (Forum)  on April 26, 2013.  The event was locally organized  through  collaboration with Fresno Business Council  and  Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, in connection  with California Forward , a statewide entity that is seeking to re vive California\u2122s economy through  increased efficiencies at the state and local levels,  and  California Stewardship Network.  The event was  filmed and broadcast by  Valley PBS; recordings of the 6 -hour Forum can be viewe d on the  website for  the California  Par tnership  for the San Joaquin Valley : http://sjvpartnership.org/about -us/san -joaquin -valley -regional -economic -forum/ .  More than 250 stakeholders  representing  higher  education,  state and local  government,  business,  workforce/economic development, and  community  based  organizations  heard  presentations on  regional  progress and economic opportunit ies  in the San Joaquin Valley  and participated in  a priority -setting  exercise . Building from the inaugural event  held  in 201 2 which  focused  heavily  on the Ag Value  Chain,  this year\u2122s forum reviewed progress made in the region over the past year, and  established  the  priorities  for  implementation in  the coming year.  Forum speakers  made presentations focused  on stewardship,  the  Regional Industry Cluster s Initiative , local issues, and economic development paradigm s. The  theme of  the event was \ufb01 Creating a great  place for business and people.\ufb02    Rather than simply take a traditional look at economic development  as smokes tack chasers , the event  challenged attendees to view  economic development  through a  triple bottom line  - economic,  environmental and equity impacts. This approach was promoted through highlighting t he need for greater

The presentation by Doug Noll, a  Fresno attorney,  explored the connectivity of both,  and how success cannot occur in one without the  other.    To promote an innovative economic/ workforce development collaborative,  Mike Dozier,  OCED  executive  director, explained how and why  Fresno State  in partnership with numerous individuals and  agencies throughout the Valley  established the Regional Industry Cluster s Initiative (RICI).  RICI is  an  aggressive , proactive  program created and administered by  Fresno State  for  a collaboration of  economic/workforce development providers , such as higher education, workforce agencies, government,  and professional  organizations , with the intent of engaging  the private sector to address  the  needs for  greater success  in the Valley . An  8-county, 27,000 square mile network is under  way with a great deal of  momentum.   Local issues were addressed in a moderated panel of four San Joaquin Valley  mayors of  cities wi th  varying populations, pro viding  insight as to how the stewardship approach to economic develop ment is  working in their cities  and what opportunities lay ahead for greater connectivity and collaboration.  Participating  mayors included Paul Linder of Taft  (population 9,464) , Ashley Swearengin  of Fresno  (population  501,362), Garrad Marsh of Modesto  (population 202,751) , and Luis Molina of Patterson  (population 20,578) .   During lunch,  attendees  were asked to consider and rate action priorities for the region  and the state of  California. The  top two selected regional priority items by category are included below .  Infrastructure Top Priorities:   Maintain/improve regional corridors    Utilize telehealth/telemedicine to improve health care access in rural  communities

aVAPLU AWARD APPLICATION, AUGUST 2013 |  CASE STUDY: San Joaquin Valley Regional Economic Forum  stakeholders in this manner, the  Forum  serves as an annual check -in to evaluate and re -rank regional  priorities to drive local and statewide improvement efforts.    The recommendations from the  Forum  will be elevated to the 2013 California Economic Summit t o be  held Nov . 7-8, 2013, in Los Angeles. At the statewide event, the regional bodies convene to  identify  statewide priorities which  will be carried forward into the coming year. The Valley is well represented at  this State Summit by Fresno State and the p artners that participated in the  Forum.    OCED is responsible for working with cha mpions for each of the prioritie s and the subsequent  implementation steps th roughout the year, thus making its  role critical to the success of  Forum  activities.  The San Joaqu in Valley is one of two regions (out of 16) in the State of California  which  has a network of  regional collaborators, led by OCED, that  has  addressed as action items the  priorities set from the 2012  Forum . The San Joaquin  Valley Regional  Broadband Consorti um and the Regional Industry Clusters  Initiative were formed in response to Priority Implementation action items from the 2012  Forum.  OCED/Fresno State is able to count on multiple partners throughout the Valley for grants, work plans,  advocacy, and idea e xchanges as a direct result of the outreach process established by OCED. Because of  this objective Valley role, OCED/ Fresno State is the perfect coordinator for this regional activity .    Tag : Regional c ollaboration,  Economic  Forum

aV  CASE STUDY: San Joaquin Valley Rural Development Center   OVERVIEW  The San Joaquin Valley Rural Development Center (SJVRDC) was established by the Office of  Community and Economic Development at Fresno State in 2010 to serve as a one -stop resource center  and technical assistance  provider  for rural communities in the San J oaquin Valley.  SJVRDC is aligned  with the principal of  community engagement and  public service that is a pillar of Fresno State.  Many of  the rural communities in the region are confronted with limited resources, staff, and time that impede their  ability to  carry out projects that are vital to the socio -economic wel l-being of their residents.  SJVRDC  addresses these challenges by connecting rural communities to a wide  range of indispensable resources,  services, and expertise that helps ensure community and ec onomic development needs are met efficiently,  effectively, and affordably.   TARGET  COMMUNITIES  SJVRDC targets its services to  San Joaquin Valley  communities with populations of 50,000 or less. This  includes both incorpor ated cities and unincorporated censu s-designated p laces. Tribal communities and  nonprofits serving rural residents  also  are eligible for SJVRDC services.  Since its inception,  SJVRDC has  provided  its  services to 2 3 rural cities, 1 2 unincorporated c ensus -designated places, 10 non profits and 1  tribal community.    SERVICE  AREAS  Between its own direct services  and those of  the more than 40  partner  organizations,  SJVRDC is able to  facilitate a diverse set of expertise, resources, services and trainings to the  region\u2122s rural communities in  order to address challenges and maximize  opportunities confronting them.

We listen to what rural communities need , discuss  options with them  and , together , reach long -term solutions.  SJVRDC can provide assistance in the following areas:   Capacity Building   Community Gardening   Community Planning   Digital Li teracy   Economic Development Planning   Entrepreneurship   Farmers\u2122 Market Development   Financial Literacy   Financing   Grant Writing & Management   Housing   Internship Placement   Land Remediation   Nonprofit  Incorporation &  Reinstatement   Public Health & Wellness   Renewab le Energy   Small Business Development   Strategic Planning   Transportation   Water and Wastewater Infrastructure  SERVICE  HIGHLIGHTS  The services  SJVRDC provides directly or facilitates are done  at no cost to a rural community; however,  there are instances  when  nominal fees are applied to the services  it provides because of the amount of  time involved in delivering assistance. These fees are meant to cover a fraction  of costs  and provide a  level of revenue that will sustain further activ ities  in other rural communities . As a result,  SJVRDC has  generated over $75,000 in revenue from its fee -based services , which include grant -writing services  and  contracted rural projects.
p405
aVECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT  PLANNING   In conjunction with the Taft  Dist rict  Chamber of Commerce and members of the Greater Taft Economic  Development Authority  (GTEDA),  SJVRDC facilitated an economic development strategy  for the City of  Taft which was adopted for implementation by its  City Council.  The  strategy  was developed o ver an 8 -month  period and  consisted of 13 educational and planning sessions that culminated with a Strengths,  Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis  and implementation steps . The economic  development  strategy  includes input from  GTEDA\u2122s  30-member advisory committee  comprising  various  community stakeholders in Taft , Calif., from both  public and private sectors.

aV APLU AWARD APPLICATION, AUGUST 2013 |  CASE STUDY: San Joaquin Valley Rural Development Center  TECHNOLOGY : DIGITAL  LITERACY AND  SMALL  BUSINESS  DEVELOPMENT  SJVRDC has delivered 3 different training modules to low -income, Span ish -speaking residents and  business owners in the City of Firebaugh that have totaled a combined 96 hours of instruction.  The first  module was held in the spring of 2012 and offered basic digital literacy training to a group of 20  community members. A seco nd group comprised of 12 residents and small business owners participated   in a module that introduced elements of small b usiness technology integration, such as e -commerce,  digital photography, Adobe Photoshop, and social media.  For example, one participat ing student applied  the skillsets he learned to  begin  sell ing  his vehicles on Craigslist  and PayPal . The third module provided  QuickBooks training to 15 small business owners and residents.

aVWATER AND  WASTEWATER  INFRASTRUCTURE  SJVRDC  assisted the  City of  Farmersville  in conducting  surveys of households in the unincorporated  census -designated place of Cameron Creek Colony to  assess  water and wastewater infrastructure and  quality.  A total of 85 households were contacted with 54 percent agreeing to have the  City of Farmersville  test the quality of their private well for contaminants. The level of residents\u2122 interest in having the City of  Farmersville provide water utility services  also  was assessed, and 46 percent of residents were in favor of   a sub -regional  infrastructure solution.  SJVRDC also assisted the City of Farmersville in identifying an  affordable lab to analyze the water well samples collected in Cameron Creek.  The goal of these services   was to provide a credible, third -party entity (Fresno State)  as the face of important community data  collection process that will affect local  planning .    GRANT  WRITING  & MANAGEMENT  SJVRDC has provided 5 grant writing trainings to representativ es of rural communities and non profits  from all 8 counties in the San Joaquin Valley. Its no -cost training module has been delivered to  more than  140 individuals  using an interactive approach that includes online database research . The goal of these  training modules  is to build local gr ant  writing capacity in rural communities in order to increase

aV CASE STUDY:  Central Valley Venture Forum   Central Valley Venture Forum (C VVF) was founded in 2005 by  Fresno State\u2122s  Lyles Center for  Innovation and Entrepr eneurship  and the Central Valley Fund , in an effort to address  a pressing  need  in  the Central Valle y to increase  capital investment  in innovative ventures.  The  focus of  CVVF  is to provide  entrepreneurs and businesses access to capital  and relationships  to support innovation, create jobs, and  encourage  economic  growth.     CVVF  was  established  to bring tog ether investors and entrepreneurs  in the Central Valley.  Participants  and attendees  have  include d entrepreneurs, both successful and aspiring, along with  venture capitalists,  investment bankers, angel investors, valuation executives, corporate executives,  and community leaders.  In an informal setting , entrepreneurs  - whether new or seasoned  - have the opportunity to network with  those professionals who may  provide  essential links to the development of a successful venture.   The  daylong program  comprises  thr ee components : guest speakers, panel speakers  and the Valley  Entrepreneur Showcase.  Previous speakers  include  former eBay CEO  and current Hewlett -Packard CEO  Meg  Whitman , and California  State Controller John Chi ang.  Panel speakers  have  include d accomplishe d angel  investors  and venture capitalists,  as well as  a Hispanic business panel.  Presentations  made  by policy  officials and market leaders from the private sector and institutional investment communities  focused on   benefi tting  entrepreneurs  and business le aders in attendance.   The Valley Entrepreneur Showcase , one of the three main components,  offers entrepreneurs the  opportunity to  present  their startup business to  a panel of judges  made up of  potential  investors. Th e Showcase  has provided  many entrepreneu rs the opportunity to raise capital, gain visibility and  generate  support from both  funders and  community members.

In recent years, many startups from the Central Valley have showc ased their business at CVVF . The  recent winner  of the 7 th Annual  Central  Valley Venture Forum in 2012 was the  Valley\u2122s  Grilled  Chz  Development, Inc. Grilled Chz opened its first store in Clovis, C alif ., in March 2012 , and took \ufb01Best in  Show\ufb02  CVVF  honors in October 2012. Grilled Chz ha s garnered  enough local support  to  open  a second  restaurant  in  neighboring  Fresno  barely  one year  after  opening  the  doors  of its  first restaurant . Other  companies , which  have  been showcased , presented innovations in energy, food safety, medicine,  marketing , and  social media .  CVVF  has  had strong backing from the Central Valley Fund allowing it seven su ccessful years, with  more  Forums  planned . The goal of the  Fund  is to provide private capital to small to mid -sized businesses  within  California \u2122s Central Valley. The  Fund  offers  mezzanine capital to businesses  that  might not be able  to obtain desired amoun ts of funding from banks.     Fresno State\u2122s  Lyles Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship and the  Central Valley Fund  continu e to  encourag e the flow  of  capital investment  into innovative ventures  in the Central Valley . The results of  these efforts  will b e on  display in Fresno this October as the 8 th Annual  CVVF will bring together  innovative ventures,  strategic relationships, and  capital investment opportunities, .

aVIMPROVEMENT  PLAN  In order to gauge Fresno State\u2122s  effectiveness and perception in the region,  the Office of Community and  Economic Development ( OCED ) incorporated the APLU Institutional Self -Assessment Tool to Enhance  Regional Innovation and Prosperity. Personalized emails with the Assessment Survey attached were sent  to 1,000 regional leaders. The response rate was 12%, or 121 completed surveys. Respo ndents included:   Department heads (47%), Presidents/CEOs (29.8%), elected officials (3.3%), and staff (2.5%),  representing government (37.5%), business (25.8%), nonprofit (15%), community agencies (10%), and  education (9.2%). In addition to the survey, OCE D engaged stakeholders through the  San Joaquin Valley  Regional Economic Forum more fully described in the case study.   Respondents  gave the University high marks for its contribution to the economic growth of the region  (72% good or excellent ratings), and  for assistance to small businesses and entrepreneurs. The   respondents  appear to  understand the contribution and collaboration that the  University provides for  regional innovation and economic growth initiatives , as well as,  the  importance  of developing  partnerships with all levels of government. Dissemination of information about University community  collaborations was an appreciated activity as well.   While the Universit y\u2122s  role in community engagement is rated highly important and is understood and  appre ciated by the community at large, there are areas of improvement identified . The three identified  areas for improvements are:   Communication s,  Regional  Economic Growth and Innovation , and  Linking to the Community .    The assessment survey helped to clearly  identify the three improvements areas . These areas  of  improvement  are not a shocking revelation to anyone involved in the process  at Fresno State . Communication of successes and programs has long been a  challenge . Advancements in social media and  
p417
aVAPLU  AWARD  APPLICATION , AUGUST 2013  | IMPROVEMENT PLAN  FRESNO STATE  | OCED  communica tion tools make it both easier and more difficult to communicate  effectively . Information over  load is a  problem . Finding the best way to communicate take s time, money and creativity. Aligning  education and professional development to meet the skills gap o f the region is a problem throughout the  nation as well as the San Joaquin Valley . This too involves a communication path between industry , workforce and educational leaders at all levels.  Finally, finding a clear way of linking  University  resources and ex pertise to communit ies  is an on -going process that matures with time and partnerships . All of these improvement areas are linked and will provide an even better community engagement model  once implemented.   THREE  AREAS OF  IMPROVEMENT  1. Communications .   Areas of improvement  identified in the survey  include communicating the  University\u2122s role in regional innovation and economic growth initiative s; how well  it contributes to the  economic development of the region; how open, accessible, and responsive  it is t o community needs; and  how  it works with regional leaders.     These  areas  might be best communicated through outreach and speaking opportunities as well as  explain ed and highlight ed in newsletters. However, the best an d most time -intensive communication is  one-on-one or through partnerships. When the  University has entered into partnerships , there have been  positive results with long lasting feelings of mutual respect and willingness to partner in the future.    The respondents  to the survey  indicate that the University is not communicating as well as it should. Over  50% still felt that the University did a good or excellent job, which is encouraging and hopeful. Of  particular concern is the 17.1% dissatisfaction rate given to \ufb01broadly dissem inates information about  university/community collaboration .\ufb02 The Universit y\u2122s  role in the  California  Partnership  for the San  Joaquin Valley  and the  San Joaquin Valley  Regional Industry Cluste rs Initiativ e (RICI) is very  exhaustive. Newsletters and meeting  information are  sent to a broad list -serv e throughout the Valley  on a  
p418
aVAPLU  AWARD  APPLICATION , AUGUST 2013  | IMPROVEMENT PLAN  FRESNO STATE  | OCED  regular basis . Most of the  responder s to this survey have  received information about this activity.  There  still seems to be  vagueness  about the role the University plays  in this initiat ive .   There  also  appears to be a disconnection between the  role  the University plays in the regional economy , which was rated very high , and  accessibility to the University , which rated much lower . Fresno State  Connect , a relatively new program at the  University  and  administered by OCED,  can  play a bigger role to  bridge this  gap.  To be as effective as possible, t his role will have to have internal support from all  University  schools and top administrators .   Following  is a  list of activities  the Univers ity will undertake  during  the next year to address the need for  communication s improvements:   Improve the external and internal efforts of  Fresno State Connect . There needs to be a clear  message that finding resources at the University should begin at  Fresno State Connect .  -  A communications plan for  Fresno State Connect  should include a brand ing  and  marketing plan.   - Work with economic development and workforce develop ment agencies to get the word  out to businesses and industries  about  Fresno State Conn ect.   Establish a plan to c ommunicate  University  programs and opportunities to the region.  The  plan  will  include electronic newsletters, website links and co -branding .   Expand and market the user -friendly portals  and  websites that identify faculty/staff ex pertise and  R&D capabilities.   Increase marketing of Universit y activities by identifying successful case studies of innovation  and research on campus in collaboration with industry.    Continue to communicate the Universit y\u2122s  successes in regional collaborat ion and the economy.

aVAPLU  AWARD  APPLICATION , AUGUST 2013  | IMPROVEMENT PLAN  FRESNO STATE  | OCED  2. Regional Economic Growth and Innovation .  How well the  University creates educational and  professional development opportunities that are relevant to regional economic growth and innovation.  Respondents felt that this service was very important or important (89.5%).  Yet t he highest rating  received was \ufb01no basis for judgment\ufb02 (44.1%) , which means respondents were not aware  of  what the  University provides  in this area . The University did receiv e high marks from those that were familiar with  its program s, 51.9% rated as excellent or good , while 12.4% felt that  its  efforts were poor or very poor.  The University has created a number of programs and established cohorts across schools  on campus  to  address industry cluster needs in agriculture, engineering, planning and entrepreneurship. These programs  appear to be  familiar mostly to those that have used them or worked with the University to establish  them . Others are not aware of the University\u2122s effo rts in this area.   The University\u2122s lead in the California Partnership for the San Joaquin Valley (Partnership) created the   Regional Industry Cluster Initiative (RICI). Through RICI , there will be a greater focus on  accommodating future development opportunities within the Valley\u2122s seven industry clusters : Agriculture, Health and Wellness,  Manufacturing, Water Technology, Energy, Logistics , and Public  Infrastructure . RICI aligns workforce and economic development age ncies, higher education and  government with  the  industry cluster s to address their needs  for success in real time. The issues being  addressed include skills gap, innovation and technology, and regulatory restrictions . Fresno State through  OCED is the lead  agency.     The one area that the University scored lower was in supporting early  stage innovation (23.9% excellent  or good). This is an area that the University is just starting to grow and offers potential for future   opportunity.  A Commercialization/Techno logy Transfer Program Manager was hired to create more  opportunity for faculty and community entrepreneurs. Additionally, t he Lyles Center has  done a good job  to provide venture capital opportunities through the  Central Valley Venture  Forum held annually  since  
p420
aVAPLU  AWARD  APPLICATION , AUGUST 2013  | IMPROVEMENT PLAN  FRESNO STATE  | OCED  2005 (see case study ). Recently, the Fresno State Foundation created New California Ventures , LLC, a  funding source for  Valley  entrepreneurs and Fresno State faculty researchers.   The following is a list of activities that the University will undertak e over the next year to address the  need for  regional economic growth and innovation  improvements:   Expand cohort development  to address the regional skills needs. The University has established a   water  cohort  and  urban and  regional  planning cohort that  include professors from multiple  colleges a ddressing a single issue. High -speed rail  is  an  issue area that  may  need to have a cohort  established. The Valley will be the site of the first  high -speed train  system in  the nation with  construction starting in 2 014. There are multiple skills needed  for this infrastructure project  that  are not  currently  available  in the region.  The University will take the lead on addressing and   meeting th ese need s.   Work with  the private sector  through the RICI process to address  needs for future job growth  in  industry clusters. RICI  partners  (Community Colleges, WIBs, EDCs, Cities, Counties,  professional organizations) are gearing up for this activity. A grant has been submitted to provide  funding for a Valley Employment Study, w hich will identify the skills gap and what training and  educational programs are needed to fill that gap.   Expand  the Universit y\u2122s  role in reaching out to industry for research and innovation . This can be  addressed through RICI,  Fresno State Connect , or oth er community engagement efforts.    Expand the role of the University in obtaining venture capital and other supportive programs for  start -up and spin -off businesses . Continue to provide guidance for  Valley  entrepreneurs with New  California Ventures , LLC, the Venture Capital Forum, and federal grants (e.g. , SBIR /STTR ) through the Lyles Center  Commercialization/Technology Transfer Program Manager .

aVAPLU  AWARD  APPLICATION , AUGUST 2013  | IMPROVEMENT PLAN  FRESNO STATE  | OCED   Align  Small Business Development  Center (SBDC) agencies  to Campus Tech Transfer and  Commercialization  effo rts and  Community Development Financial Institutions  for funding  opportunities for  Valley businesses.    Develop close partnership with U niversity of  California,  Merced for research and innovation.    3. Linking to the Community .  How well the  University links  its resources and expertise to  community needs.  The  majority of respondents felt that this service was  a very important or important  service for the University to provide (81.1%). An even larger number of respondents than the previous  section had no basis  to judge the University in this arena (44.4%).  Technology transfer/patents is  one area  in which  University ha s not had a lot of involvement; it  appears to skew  the results. The University did  receive higher marks for entrepreneurship and creation of start up/spin -off businesses (70.5% rating as  excellent or good). This is most like ly attributed to the Lyles Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship,  which has enjoyed a great deal of success in this area. Maintaining \ufb01user -friendly portals and websites for  faculty/staff expertise\ufb02 ranks behind tech transfer/patents in responders \u2122 awareness.  Possible efforts to  improve this perception include:   Identifying  opportunities to open University labs to industry for pilot projects.   Expand ing  opportunities to secure research contracts, licenses, and other agreements with  industry.   Expanding early  stage innovation (proof of concept, R&D, pilot facilities) programs.   Incorporating  this opportunity in the work of  Fresno State Connect .   If successf ul, this improvement plan will result  in  greater awareness of University resources and assets ; increased  connectivity and collaboration between the San Joaquin Valley and the University; and a more  economically diverse and competitive region.  It will allow  us to c hip away at the negative metrics such  as:  low  per capita income,  low  household income,  low  educational attainment, and  high poverty rates.

aVAPLU  AWARD  APPLICATION , AUGUST 2013  | IMPROVEMENT PLAN  FRESNO STATE  | OCED  Unlike  any other entity , Fresno State is in a very unique position to have a tremendous and quantifiable  posi tive impact on the San Joaquin Valley.   Fresno State has been working for  more than 15 years to move the needle  forward on  economic growth in  the Valley. It is not an easy proposition. Why? Historically, t he top three barriers to  economic  improvement  are : 1) lack of collaboration  (too many silos), 2 ) lack of education,  and  3) lack of adequate  funding. Being creative and collaborative is very important to address ing  the se barriers. While the  University is the leading institution to bring about change, it  cannot do it without the full cooperation of  many other partners . The problems are systemic and pervasive. It will take the entire village to raise the  Valley. With collaboration comes  a better opportunity for  funding from foundations and others willing to  invest  in a region that is set up to help itself. Collaboration and funding will increase educational  opportunities. These things are now in place after many years of trying. It\u2122s just a matter of  implementation and patience.  Fresno State is committed to  connecting, collaborating and advocating for  the region.

aV    22     SECTION  3   Growth/Improvement Plan   (word count: 1278/2000)   The insights gained f rom the   self - study an d the feedback of stakeholders  provided the team with   a  numb er of ideas to grow and improve   economic engagement .   These insights are being  communicated to the Georgi a Tech leadership for inclusion in the Strategic Plan tasks moving  forward.  Three key areas o f improvement are highlighted   below:   1)   Improve Communications of Economic Development   Opportunities and  Successes     A major component of the Georgia Tech Strategic Plan and the Georgia Tech Research Strategy is  to  expand the economic impact and global reach   of  the Institute. Currently, communication s   about   onomic development activities are   managed by in dividual units with oversight  and assistance of the Georgia Tech  Institute Communications .  The findings of the internal survey  indicate d   that communication improvement is recognized as an issue at all levels at Georgia Tech  and that additional attention i s needed to  tell the full story about the overwhelming impact we are  having on society and the economy.    90% of the survey responders indicated   that communication   ,   but 48% of the   - 3 (out of 5).    This concern was also echoed in the   Dedicated staff for economic  development communications and greater coordination of branding of the   numerous economic  development programs were specifically  identified .  Based on these findings, the  following  improvement   recommendations  are planned :
p519
aV   Hiring a full - time Marketing and Communications Manager to support EI2 and its  programs.   The search  will b egin   July 1, 2014 .
p520
aV   Developing and executing a strategic marketing and communications plan solely focused  on economic development activities, in conjunction with Institute Communications.    Members of Communications Department  are currently working o n the details of the plan

aV     economic development contributions.   The completion  date for   this recommendation is  June   1, 2015.    Resources are sti ll to be determined  but may include creating an advertising  budget, new websites, targeted campaigns in different areas of the state .
p522
aVindustry leaders to recognize the tremendous societal and economic impact Georgia Tech  has on the state and region. New collaborations and increased state support may result.  The resources for this  project are yet to be determined. It may include funding for web  development, strategy consultants, etc.   Estimated c omp letion date for this project is  June  30, 2015 .
p523
aV    Producing and promoting more stories about economic development activities, startup  com panies, industry outreach, etc.    The communications department is already doing this   to a limited extent .   Our team recommends   increasing  this effort   at the institute and unit  level .  A more complete understanding, among internal and external stakeholders,  of the  tremendous societal and economic impact Georgia Tech is having on the state and region   is  needed.   The  proposed    EI2 Marketing/Communications manager will develop new  strategies for   telling our economic impact story  economic  impact from the various Georgia Tech units
p524
aV  2)   Improve ease of identification of G eorgia  T ech   expertise, resources, and programs for  external stakeholders .   As a large and complex institution, Georgia Tech recognizes that it can often be difficult for our  stakeholders  to  connect to the right expertise or resource.    This was also confirmed  by the  surveys responders.    88% of the external stakeholders thought tha   ,   but only 35% of the respond ers thought  that Georgia tech was   doing a great job in this area.     A number of efforts to improve access and  
p525
aV    24     thereby increase industrial engagement  and sponsorship are currently underway.   All of these  efforts are in - line with increasing our economic engagement by helping solve  societal   challenges.   Efforts to improve access inclu de th e continued growth of our Inter disciplinary  Research Institutes ( I RIs ) , implementation of GTScholar, and development of a searchable  database of  specialized   GT facilities and equipment.  In addition, enhancement is continuing on  a new contracting scheme, the Contract Continuum, to make it easier for industry and  univers ity researchers to engage at any point in the R&D process     from early - stage research  to product launch.
p526
aV  Today,  te n IRIs have been initiated and two   more are planned .  These IRIs are providing a logical  doorway for specific industrial segments such as  energy or robotics to engage with Georgia  Tech.   Details are each IRI   shown below   can be reviewed at  http://www.research.gatech.edu/institutes .

aV GTScholar   will offer a service relevant to all Georgia Tech faculty members and researchers by  compiling their research, teaching, publications, and professional activities information in one  central location.  This will allow researchers and staff to more easily a nd effectively   collaborate  and connect external stakeholders with the right expert at Georgia Tech.  GTScholar is currently  in Beta testing and plans are to fully implement it during 2015.     Lastly, Georgia Tech is currently developing a campus - wide databas e of specialized facilities and  equipment to improve cross - campus sharing and broader access and use by external  stakeholders.  Currently ,   this database is concentrating on equipment related to material  research, but plans exist to expand it to all areas.     The database will include specifics on  availability, capability, and costs.
p529
aV   Together, all of these efforts will improve ease of access for our external stakeholders.   This  will be measure d   by the in crease in the number of privately   funded research,   testing and  development projects and the  resulting increase in private versus government funding .  The  institute has a goal of doubling the percentage of private entity sponsorship over the next five  years.
p530
aV     3)   Leverage Tech Square to Enhance  Partnerships   Georgia Tech has an opportunity to enhance its engagement with economic partners by  leveragin g the assets of Tech Square.    The survey results indicated that Georgia Tech is doing a   omic players with a score of nearly  4 out of 5 from external stakeholders.  However, the discussions during the feedback forum  indicated that an opportunity exists to do even more by increasing the interaction of the  economic partners located at Tech Squar e and working together to collaborate on strategic  efforts.     As described earlier , Tech Square has physically brought together nearly all the  economic development agencies of the state including Georgia Tech , the Georgia Department  
p531
aV    26     of Economic Development   and a number of private sector economic development groups such  as the Georgia Power Resource Center .   This co - location has been useful and convenient, but to  date it has not resulted in any regular process of networking and collaboration.    Additionally,  Tech Square is also not well known throughout the state as a central resource and location for  its wide variety of economic development services and partners.
p532
aV  It is proposed that Georgia Tech lead an effort to establish more formal networking among the   partners at Tech Square and establish a mechanism to share opportunities and successes.    As a   increase   the visibility of Tech Square   as a state economic dev elopment resource and to  facilitate more partner interaction and coordination.   Proposed activities of the network  include hosting a landing page summarizing the partners, their se rvices, and contact  information;   scheduli ng regular networking meetings;  ad vertising partnering opportunities  among the network members ;   and communicating economic development successes to  stakeholders.

p572
aVAs an active member of APLU CICEP, IU was an early adopter in applied use of newly developed  assessment tools.  In 2010, OVPE deployed the internal assessment tool in a pilot program  amongst its staff and primary  university  outreach resources on economic d evelopment - related  issues located  statewide across
p573
aVeight campuses .  Nineteen of  twenty   targeted university  practitioners participated in the assessment survey.     OVPE analyzed, reviewed, and reconciled results from piloting the tool within framework of     Engage and Assert  Institutional Leadership.   This  attribute   t level of performance.    in helping to  Develop an Innovation Economy.   This feedback directly contributed to OVPE  exerting its influence to assume a more prominent   outward role on behalf of the university in  economic engagement   by leading a comprehensive study of     on the state  and developing the  Innovate   Indiana   brand ,   advancement of economic development and technology commercialization in Indiana ( S ection  1.3).     Representing one of the first institutions to implement the  new  tool, IU provided feedback to  APLU on its experiences. At the 2010 APLU Annual Meeting in Dallas, David Gard, OVPE  Assistant Vice President for Economic Development, presented  Initial Deployment of C ICEP  Internal Assessment Tool at Indiana University    this process.

aV5     1.2.1.2.  External Assessment Tool Deployment     Building on   its  development of   Innovate   Indiana , OVPE conducted an assessment  during late  summer of  2013  to evaluate the impact of     in engagement for  state/regional economic development, as perceived by key external stakeholders to the  university .   With direct input from IU regional campus resources, engag ement profiles  (Exhibit  B)  were developed for each  IU  campus to identify key partner organizations and individual  stakeholders to include in the assessment survey sample    database.

aV  ool was adapted to an online format specific to IU   and  distributed  statewide  to over 125 targeted  high value  contacts  (Exhibit C) via email.   The survey  generate d a response rate of more than twenty   percent during its  three - week deployment in  August 2013 .    Participants   were asked to assess  26   specific activities across seven   categories  (Exhibit D)   performance of IU in each given activity using a  six - point scale.
p576
aVThese results were agg regated into  the  percentage   of respondents conferring a  top - three   sur vey value (out of the range of six )  for each  activity  in  both  importance and performance.    Percentages  for activities were  then  rolled up into  average s   for each of the  seven   categories,  a gain  for both importance and performance.     The final calculated results  (Exhibit E)  indicated IU  performed highest in activities promoting  Economic Growth   and lowest in  Entrepreneurship .  By  comparison, external stakeholders rated the categories of  Entrepreneurship   and  Innovation  Infrastructure   as most important.  As a result ,  Entrepreneurship   represented   the greatest gap  between importance and performance   while  Economic Growth   enjoyed   the least gap.

aV1.2.2.  Engaging Stakeholders     Upon completion of   the external assessment, OVPE arranged for inclusion on the agendas of a  comprehensive series of major meetings / events, enabling a prepared summary of assessment  results to be presented before a wide range of key stakeholders (Exhibit F) that the process  aided in identifying.  This schedule included high - level university meetings with ranking officials,  strategic planning sessions, and an external stakeholder roundtable  forum  (Figure 1), all  enabling opportunities for OVPE to solicit direct feedback.

aV   OVPE  created the  IU Council for Regional Engagement and  Economic Development   ( CREED )  to form an enduring university - wide   forum  from   which regional  economic issues can be addressed .    Comprised of chancellor - appointed  representatives from  each campus, CREED  meets quarterly   to identify, through ongoing dialogue,   ways in which   IU  can bring its resources and expertise to bear to enhance st ate economic development efforts.   One  such  primary resource is the  Regional Economic  Development Fund   ( RED Fund )  (Exhibit   J ) , a  matching cost - share fund managed by CREED created to support campus programs and  initiatives promoting economic development at the regional level.  Through its economic  development - focused efforts, CREED fosters greater communication, enhances connecti vity,  and facilitates knowledge transfer across all IU campuses and the communities they serve.

The previous technology transfer office   was reformed as   from the University of Virginia Patent Foundation.     To gauge faculty perceptions on commercialization activities, a university - wide survey was  con ducted.  The input provided through  the high response rate of this  survey   informed the  development of a new Intellectual Property policy for the entire university.  The new policy  defined ownership interests and distribution schedules for  faculty inventors   and their  respective departments ,  laboratories , and campuses, enabling both funding of additional  research and encouraging further participation in the commercialization process.

The guide  has been translated into  Mandarin , assisting  IURTC in forging new Chin ese   research  relationships.     To  engage  faculty across the university, IURTC assigned its technology managers regional  campus coverage responsibilities in addition to their fields of scientific expertise.  IURTC also  initiated   a rec ognition program to acknowledge new faculty inventors through a series of  receptions held  each year .  The IU Innovation Center in Indianapolis, managed by IURTC, has  provided business incubation facilities and shared support services to   over fifty   startups ,  thirteen   of which have graduated since 2009.

Growth/Improvement  Plan     While OVPE has   made great strides in realizing its charge on behalf of IU, the rapidly evolving  landscape of higher education continues to place new challenges that all universities, including  IU, must effectively navigate.

aV    3.1.  Developing Systemic Engagement Infrastructure     For the purposes of  this  specific  plan  objective, infrastructure   refers to the set of  interconnected physical and organizational elements that provide framework supporting the  advancement of  Innovate   Indiana  and the IU economic engagement enterprise.  OVPE seeks to  install systemic improvements   to the core infrastructure sustaining these areas, putting into  place a more enduring institutional framework for engagement.     The IURTC intends to divest its current home, the IU Innovation Center  -   Indianapolis (a  repurposed former business furniture wa rehouse), enabling relocation into a dedicated facility  on the IUPUI campus at the site of the former Wishard Hospital.   The opportunity to relocate  IURTC on campus in proximity to IUPUI faculty and students allows for greater collaborative  opportunities  to commercialize cutting - edge research , produce new synergies with the IU     transform the Wishard site  into a hub of medical and scientific discovery.     Complementing the move, IURTC will reali gn its organizational structure to optimize its  concentration on activities committed to supporting high - potential ideas, promising startup  companies, and entrepreneurially - minded faculty.  In addition to investing more in the SpinUp

Although  Innovate   Indiana   has  implemented a comprehensive promotion and communications strategy (Section 1 .5.), OVPE  currently does not possess the depth of organizational resources permitting effective and  timely execution of the strategy across all component mediums.

aV26     Representing a bold stretch goal for the plan, IU will explore the possibility of proposing a  funding    --   in a manner similar the funding of  land - grant university extension system.  This prospect will necessita te involve developing both a   legislative strategy and a proposal framework that demonstrates how collaborating with other  state economic and workforce development agencies on clearly defined capacity - building   nnovation ecosystem and provide required return  on investment.  While IU cannot directly control the outcome of this objective, and state  budgetary constraints may reduce the likelihood of its attainment, going through this exercise  will provide valuable i nput that can be integrated into other strategic planning initiatives.     3.3 .   Becoming a Global Network Adding Value  t hrough Partnerships     Embodying t he most sweeping and long - range plan component, IU  will apply the  enhancements made to its infrastructure and network connections to  aid in developing  value - added global partnerships.  Stakeholders provided considerable input as to how IU can  proficiently  exert its influence to fulfill what they believe is    important roles.  To  become a more effective partner,  stakeholders felt that   IU   must continue  to foster an entrepreneurial culture among its faculty and students , exemplifying an  intertwined thread running throughout  the  fabri c of the institution .     Stakeholders emphasized that the university needs to offer students more experiential and  cross - disciplinary learning opportunities, enabling them to cultivate a business case approach to  effectively develop and apply their ideas in  the workplace.   Creat ing  more opportunities for  externships,  allowing  students  to  gain academic credit for their work experiences , was thought  to be a valuable undertaking as well.   Feedback indicated that faculty could  similarly  benefit  from experiential  learning   --   through interaction with industry ,   entrepreneurs,  and alumni  --   to  provide insights into integrating the practical application of ideas into teaching and research.

aV27     IUPUI ,   developed   in collaboration with the executive vic    to accomplish  these initial steps   while addressing faculty, student, and workforce needs .   Lessons learned   from the pilot program can provide the basis for similar initiatives to be  undertaken   a t other IU  campuses to  provide support     across all regions .     IU  recognizes the need for, and benefit of,  providing   more   applied technology programs  in its  curriculum offerings to  increase commercial research opportunities with potential partners  such as  Naval Surface Warfare Center ( NSWC )    life sciences industry .
p637
aV A more pervasive entrepren eurial culture attuned to applied innovation will enable the  university to engage in more effective partnerships through better understanding.   The key  partnership theme emerging from stakeholders is IU can strengthen its innovation focus  through greater  alignment with industry needs.  Industry wants to engage with the university  earlier in the commercialization process to provide feedback and to identify potential areas for  collaboration.   IU must be willing to innovate toward marketplace needs, rather t han simply  needing to market its innovations.
p638
aV To address  these concerns, OVPE plans to help facilitate new opportunities that bring industry  leaders and faculty innovators together on a more frequent basis in novel  places/venues/formats around the state , connecting with business to listen to what the market  wants and mutually target existing unmet needs.  In the process, IU can more effectively  engage with industries by becoming  more transparent and communicative so that industry  leaders know what  the un iversity can offer .    The end goal is for IU to become the university that  industry leaders turn to for innovation and partnership through collaborative practical
p639
aV Stakeho lders believe research partnerships will continue to grow in importance in the future.   By forging new dialogue with industry, IU can open  international gateways  to new  opportunities for global engagement that  can  realize greater economic  impact   for its ho me  state.   By honing an entrepreneurial culture throughout the university and refining its external  partnership capabilities, IU can elevate  I nnovate   Indiana   to new heights, extending its reach  and influence for the benefit of all Hoosiers.

Ms. Gelston, the   former Deputy  Director of the MDA,  brings a unique perspective  on  economic development, and how we can  team with partners to increase innovation and economic development throughout the state .  A  number o f university centers and institutes provided input, including representatives from our  Thad Cochran Research, Technology, and Economic Development Park   (Research Park) ; the  Office of Technology   Management   (OTM) ; National Strategic Planning & Analysis  Research  Center ( N SPARC); MSU Extension Service Center for Government and Community  Development   (Extension) ;  MSU Entrepreneur Center  (E - Center) ;   and the Center for Advanced  Vehicular Systems (CAVS) .    ,   as well as the various  existing  programs designed to spur  economic development  and innovation  across the university .  Our next task was to assess   objectively   how others thought the u niversity was performing in  these   area s .  Our approach was to utilize slightly modified internal and external stakeholder

p680
aVFor internal stakeholders, a combination of extension faculty, center directors,  researchers, and administrators were polled   based on  their participation  in any aspect of external  outreach .  Identification of these individuals highlight ed   that the number of   faculty with any  experience with or  connection to economic development and innovation was limited .  We  immediately learned we needed to be more inclusive,  so we  have  added  a  technology transfer  seminar to our fall seminar series to help engage more faculty   in our processes.   Externally, we polled a number of industries, local economic developers, state  administrators, workforce development leaders, and educators , including   representatives in the   l economic developers,  industries that have interacted with the university, significant employers in the state, and   .  We also included  t he economic development liaison   from  anothe r research university within the state .     competitiveness was completed last summer .   to embrace research universities as active partners   in economic development recruiting and also  as a way to grow industry   internally   through innovation .  The MEC  study was  very   detailed and  received input from stakeholders throughout the  state  -   including two current MSU employees  -   as well as national  consult ants who recruit in Mississippi .
p681
aV  Finally, we needed to determine objective measures to track results .  Unfortunately ,  existing metrics were very limited, so  we  developed   new  metrics  that will be used to track  progress  on an ongoing basis.  See an  example of ou r proposed metrics in Appendix B .   Our stakeholder survey and interview res ults  (see Appendix A)  provided a solid basis for  the  development of our Growth and Improvement plan and helped us identify areas where

This   process specifically highlighted that there are a number of  int ernal and external stakeholders   who  are excited about an opportunity to engage   more actively   in innovation  and economic development  opportunities with MSU.    It should be noted that t he  MEC  study, while not released publically, provides very  specific recommendations  related to partnerships between universities and economic  development entities .  This study was a result of state - wide participation of economic  development professionals, universi ties, industry, consultants, workforce leaders, and state  government officials .  The study  identified the largest challenges facing economic development  in Mississippi .  O ur Growth and Improvement Pla n includes workforce solutions based on the  finding that  t he biggest challenge  Mississippi faces is access to a skilled workforce .   The most significant lesson learned from the  surveys   was that  our messaging and  communication infrastructure within the university is much less effective than we realized   and  must be  updated and expanded .    The Economic Engagement Enterprise    2   adopted in 2012, the university clearly states its commitment to  economic development in the vision statement:    aware and involved, accessible and responsive to the many constituencies it serves, and  fully integrated with the intellectual, social, and  economic development of  the state ,  while delivering excellent programs of teaching, research, and service

The  internal group   was   more concerned with innovation and funding, while the external group  was much more interested in more active participation in economic development by the  university .  Both groups felt that better communication ,   stronger comme rcialization ,   and  improved  technology transfer strategies were needed .

This  program provides real financial incentives to develop and patent innovation developed  at   Mississippi universities.     Economic Engagement   Planning   Mississippi State University  structure .  Mississippi has a  distinct  economic development structure   compared  to other states   wherein the Mississippi Development Authority (MDA) serves the  roles of both the  administrative agency and the local developer. This model works well in Mississippi due to the  rural nature of the state and that most communities cannot afford an economic development  professional. While this model might appear to have w eaknesses, it does allow the entire state to  be represented to potential projects. MSU provides strengths in several areas that obviate  potential weaknesses by successfully assisting the state in attracting new business and industry  and better linking job  seekers with employment opportunities .  These strengths include applying  technology developed by MSU scientists and advanced data analytics to enhance the  understanding of local labor market s and employment needs in Mississippi , conducting targeted  research   to understand skill gaps  and workforce training needs  in Mississippi communities ,  a nd

These strengths have been developed through strong  partnerships  with  MS U, its research centers, and the MSU   Extension Service  that  have  been  developed with gov ernment agencies in Mississippi   at the state and local levels.   As a land grant university, exten sion is  part of who we are .  The Mississippi State  University Extension Service is a vital part of our economic prosperity outreach .  During 2014,  the Extension Service placed its first community development agents in county Extension  offices .  These new agen ts work with local governments, civic organizations, and area  development agencies to strengthen the social, economic, and environmental well - being of  communities .  The Center for Government and Community Development (GCD)   leads this  program   along with   othe r institutes ,   to help educate locally elected officials, assist rural and  municipal water systems, and support statewide emergency preparedness crews. We see this as  an area where we can help educate rural communities about economic development and help  them prepare fo r opportunities.   The university has been a member of various economic development organizations state - wide, and representatives have served on a number of committees addressing economic  development and innovation .  We have partnered with MDA and communities   on specific  projects to help in the recruitment process .  As we move forward, we will build upon these  relationships to become a more active participant and will become more proactive in the  recruitment process .    Internally, we have recently reinv ented the   Office of Technology M anagement to help  champion intellectual property issues and encourage technology transfer .  We are also working

The   recently endowed   Entrepreneur Center within our College of Business is actively working to help build business  opportunities around technology developed   at MSU , as well as help student entrepreneurs be gin  their own businesses in our business incubator.   Externally, we are trying to create more contact with the economic development  community  as well as   with   industry .  MSU  is  currently home to several centers and institutes that  are actively engaged in busi ness outreac h and recruitment efforts. CAVS - E and NSPARC are  two shining examples of how MSU supports centers and institutes in their efforts to promote  economic development through data analytics and system development.  This   objective   will  also  be  strengthened  by  dispatching more teams to local communities to visit and learn about the  needs of  developers and industry  and  through  invitations to  companies and groups to tour our  campus and  gain a better understanding of  the capabilities we bring to the   table .

By  working with local, state, and federal economic development officials, universit y centers and  institutes continue to help retain, recruit, and create jobs across the state .  MSU directly employs  over 4,600 people throughout the state and indirectly creates an additional 2,500 private and  public sector jobs .  MSU jobs account for more th an $438 million in personal income that  translates into approximately $42 million in state and local taxes annually. With around 3,000  graduates per year  -   the majority of whom find jobs in the state  -   each class generates  approximately $4 million in state   and local taxes every year.

Relationships between the University, Industry, and Government   Over the years, officials at local, regional, and state levels have looked for clear  indicators of the impact of university research funding on the economy .  The results of a recent   forecasted from  2012 - 202 0   showed that every $1 million increase in funding  would result in  an estimated 22 new  jobs with an average salary of $36,825. In FY14,   the university received more than $200 million  in grants and contracts from federal agencies and private  entities . Based on the results of the  REMI impact model,  this means that  MSU research funding  has an  impact  that  is equivalent to  the creation of  3,00 0 to 4,000 jobs in the state   that pay  the average salary listed above.

Camgian Microsyste ms was founded in December 2006   by CEO Dr. Gary Butler,  with the vision of becoming a leader in combining innovative technologies in the areas of low - power  microelectronics, sensors, wireless communications and data analysis to  develop  solutions  that provide valuable decision analytics for customers in the government and commercial  markets.   Camgian is a leader in developing advanced information technologies a nd solutions.  From ultra - low power processors to advanced sensing platforms, Camgian engineers are  pioneering leading - edge innovations that are enabling a new generation of high performance  wireless information technologies and products for the defense, se curity, industrial ,   and  commercial markets.   The future for the park is bright .  We are currently building a university data center  to, in  part, provide research - as - a - service to public and private entities, and are in the design phase   of a  new home for our  I nstitute for Imaging & Analytical Technologies   within the park .  This service  center will provide access to a multitude of state - of - the - art equipment that can be used to meet  both university and industry needs .  The university has already constructed the  basic  infrastructure for the P hase II expansion of the park  that will cover 45 adjacent acres, with  property already identified for Phases III and IV.

Currently, communications related to all activities  within the Office of Research and Economic Development   (ORED)   are overseen by the   with   one dedicated staff person assigned for all of the   cations .  There is a very obvious need for more coordination in communicating  the numerous economic and community development programs across the various colleges, and  more targeted communications based on partner needs .  Specific improvement recommendations   include:

aVDevelop a strategic marketing and communications plan     MSU is committed to  creating a strategic marketing and communications   plan focused on  economic development activities based on the strengths of our university centers and institutes  (See Figure 1   below ) .   This  will   include a review and update of  the websites for the various  ORED Research Centers and Institutes ensuring  a lin k to the  main  ORED website  is included.  This review will be  aimed at ensuring those navigating any ORED affiliated site know that MSU   is focused on  economic development and innovation  across a variety of areas , and will help drive  users to appropriate univ ersity contacts.

aVMake it a priority   MSU must c ommunicat e   internally that economic development and innovation are university  priorities .  This requires the various colleges within the university to encourage the inclusion of  disclosures, patents and innovation in hiring, evaluation, promotion and tenure processes.     Improve the Climate for Innovation at Mississippi State University     MSU leadership is committed to innovation - led economic development, but  acknowledges that the un iversity infrastructure and administrative support to make innovation  thrive needs improvement .  Historically, this process has been somewhat decentralized across  various colleges, centers, and institutes .  Our former Office of Entrepreneurship and Technolog y  Transfer was available for administrative support, but very little innovation vision existed .  Both  internal and external stakeholders agreed that this area needed to be addressed.     To that end, MSU recently centralized entrepreneurship activities into a  new university  center .  The Entrepreneur Center, housed within the College of Business, provides a platform for  both student and faculty entrepreneurs and business and industry to interact .  At our recent annual  Investing in Innovation (I - 3) Day,  the center  provided an opportunity for researchers and industry  representatives to socialize, students and start - up companies to impress, and thoughts of  future  possibilities to ignite .   investors were able to see a number of presentations in one day and provide valuable real - world  feedback to the participants .

The  key to success in thi s office is insuring strong processes, meeting regularly with researchers, and  providing great internal customer service .  We are now ramping up staffing to insure that these  activities are possible .  Our next steps in this improvement process are:
p733
aVUpdate   ou r Technology Transfer Policies .  MSU has progressive licensing revenue - sharing policies that are very favorable to the researcher as well as his  or her  department  or center .  Unfortunately, much of the intellectual property identified at MSU is precluded  fro m protection due to mismanagement of the disclosure process .  We are implementing  new educational programs aimed at helping faculty and researchers understand the  intellectual property life cycle, how and when to disclose, and the impact of publication  on t he process .
p734
aV Increase Industry - Sponsored Research .  MSU maintains close collaborations with a  number of industries throughout the state, but industry sponsored research lags  significantly behind total extramural research expenditures .  We are now taking a  much  more liberal approach to IP ownership when industry is funding university research .  We  are more interested in partnerships with industry that lead to job creation and economic  development than we are licensing profits .  Industry visitation and research   opportunities  are being sought with a number of industries with the objective of long - term partnerships.
p735
aVStreamline the licensing and contract processes .  MSU is   reevaluating our contract and  licensing processes to make them faster and more business friend ly .  We are also  including other related campus units such as Sponsored Programs Administration to help  with this process.

aVPromote the Mississippi University Research Authority Act .  Existing state  statutes  allow   researchers who develop intellectual property   with the university to have the  opportunity to exclusively license their technology and develop a start - up company while  still employed by the university .  The program allows for the researcher to take an  extended sabbatical before deciding whether he wish es to stay with the university or  leave and work with the new company permanently .  This progressive program has  allowed a number of our researchers the ability to start very successful technology  companies.
p738
aVMake Technology a Priority .  Innovation and econom ic development must be seen by  faculty as a priority of the university .  Ensuring that technology development is a priority  for faculty requires the various colleges within the university to encourage the inclusion  of disclosures, patents and innovation thr ough the hiring, evaluation, and promotion and  tenure processes .  Institutionalizing technology development in this way will ensure that  this is a priority long - term.   Workforce Development  Growth  Strategies  throughout   the State     The MEC competitiveness  study identified the lack of a skilled workforce as   .  This opinion is shared by site selection  consultants and existing Mississippi industries as well as our external stakeholders .  Even with an  unemployme nt rate significantly higher than the national average, Mississippi currently has over  33,000 unfilled jobs (see   http://www.mississippiworks.org/ ) .  This indicates a  measurable   gap in  the skills of existing job seekers and the skills needed for the jobs available.    system, with MSU being called upon to provide engineers and scientists .  Today,  however, it is  
p739
aVAPLU CICEP Innovation and Economic Prosperity University     Page  28   of  38   May 1, 2015   Mississippi State  University   apparent that the workforce crisis in Mississippi will take the combined efforts of participants  from many sources to address the issues .  MSU representatives are involved in a multi - agency  task force that is looking at workforce development  beginning in middle school, and exploring a  number of routes to employment success .  Some routes will involve technical training at  community colleges, and other routes will lead to professional and technical degrees through the  university system .  MSU sees  three primary areas where we can have a significant impact on  workforce:
p740
aVIncrease the number  and quality  of STEM graduates .  The Bagley College of  Engineering is the largest in the state, with over 3,700 students .  The need for engineers  and computer science   graduates continues to outpace the increases in enrollment that  MSU has seen .  To address this need, we have developed partnerships with a community  college on the gulf coast and will offer an undergraduate degree from the community  college campus which wi ll begin in 2016 .  This program addresses the unmet needs of an  engineering program in the region .  We also have extensive internship and co - op  programs to insure the graduates have applied experience as well as academic skills .  To  encourage disadvantaged st udents to major in engineering, summer bridge programs are  offered to help build skills to prepare students for the engineeri ng curriculum .  Finally,  our on line graduate engineering program, which is ranked number 18 in the nation by  U.S. News and World Rep orts , provides the ability to pursue an advanced degree while  working .  Our distance learning and online programs provide ways for current industry  employees to acquire advanced skills while continuing their employment .  Based on the  input from the energy in dustry in Mississippi,  MSU will offer a degree in petroleum  
p741
aVAPLU CICEP Innovation and Economic Prosperity University     Page  29   of  38   May 1, 2015   Mississippi State  University   engineering   beginning in the fall of 2015 .  We will continue to identify ways to increase  enrollment and graduation rates in our STEM programs.
p742
aVProvide Highly - Specialized Technical Continuing Educa tion for Industry .  As  technology changes rapidly, there is a real need for technical professionals to maintain  their skills .  MSU, through CAVS - E, provides highly specialized training courses that are  needed by industry .  Classes offered are based on input f rom industry, and MSU plans to  continue and expand this program so that classes can be offered in multiple locations  throughout the state .  (See Figure 2 for sample class listings.) We are hiring additional  faculty and plan to expand this model to other are as for national certifications, such as  computer classes.
p743
aV  Provide Workforce Data Analysis on Existing Workforce Skills .  As industries  change, move, and grow, the existing workforce develops specific skills .  When  companies close, reduce size, or relocate,  there is still value in the skillset of the  displaced workers left behind .   (NSPARC) has developed analytical tools and processes, including mobile apps such as  Mississippi Works ( http://www.mississippiw orks.org/ ), that help look at employee skills  and education rather than simply relying on job titles .  This allows for a better match of  skills and education with needs across sectors. For example, industries may find that  some of the exact same skills used   in furniture manufacturing and food processing can be  applied to tire manufacturing .  This was actually the case for  Yokohama Tire Company   who recently located in West Point, Mississippi.
p744
aVAPLU CICEP Innovation and Economic Prosperity University     Page  30   of  38   May 1, 2015   Mississippi State  University   By looking   at the combination of skills and education, workforce training programs can  also be developed that cover basic skills customized to meet the unique needs of a  company .  Collaboration among units on campus can create real opportunities to radically  overhaul   basic skills and technical training delivery in the state. For example, a  collaboration between NSPARC and the Research Curriculum Unit could result in the  development of unique workforce training solutions that can then be disseminated  through the commun ity college system for delivery to participants .  MSU plans to  continue to reach out to state and regional developers to assist with identifying potential  i n d u st ri e s  t o  ta r get for recruitment.

aVThe   endnote    NC State Survey Methodology  III   captures the  specific steps taken to deploy and  analyze the survey s   sent to our int ernal and external stakeholders.     Defining Innovation and Economic Prosperity     Innovation   is the creative generation of new knowledge and the timely transfer of these novel ideas and  discoveries, including new or improved products, processe s or services, to the marketplace for the  public good. At NC State, innovation is synonymous with driving significant positive change.     Economic prosperity   means that the economy generally is doing well and that most people have  sufficient income for essen tials and perhaps some extra for  investments to  improve quality of life. It  means businesses are hiring and job opportunities are available. It does not mean that everyone has a  job or that everyone is well off, but that the economy has positive momentum   overall . For NC State,  economic prosperity means the university is playing a significant role in driving economic improvements

S maller group meetings  of the IEP campus working group  were held in January,   February and  March .   The  larger  group held   an open - ended discussion to  look at the IEP survey data, the Carnegie  report information and other materials to  provide both qualitative and quantitative feedback  regarding  which  areas should be selected for accom plishment and for growth/improvement .  This meeting was  structured so the working group could look   at  the entirety of   data collection   and gain  additional   insights  from individuals on campus who were heavily involved in the Carnegie and SACS processes.  Infor mation  drawn from Carnegie   and  from  previous economic development studies ,   including the UNC Tomorrow     Benchmark Economic Development Impacts   ( BEDI )   I  and   II   reports   allowed the IEP  working group to select the areas of accompl ishment a nd growth/im provement.

aVB y using the experience of the Carnegie and SACS groups  as well as  the survey   and new metrics   data , the  large group was able   to  validate and  support each selection.  Because NC State is a large university with a  robust economic  engagement enterprise, m ultiple options were considered for areas of accomplishment  and for growth/ improvement. The   IEP working g roup and members of the Carnegie team  agreed that  the data and experience of the SACS and Carnegie effort s pointed to clear are as of   accomplishment in  industry - based partnerships, community -   and  university - based economic development, and technology - based innovation.   Using the same data -   and experience - based process,   t he group determined that three  areas of growth / improvement  were  the   entrepreneurship   community ,  knowledge  management/coordination, and communication and dissemination of information to internal   and  external stakeholders.

NC State   has aligned our strategic plan   to the UNC Tomorrow recommendations in th e   a rea of economic transformation. We are  partnering  with regional economic developers to identify and enhance economic clusters in our region ,   including  bio technology,   educational  gaming, non woven and high - performance textiles, smart - grid   technology ,  p ower electronics, analytics,  decision sciences and agriculture.  One statistic illustrates  the impact  that  all  16 UNC  s ystem schools have on the economy of North Carolina :   - 20 11   federal and  privately funded research pumped over  $1.5   billion   in to the state economy   in direct annual impact , and  this spending was associated with almost  29 ,000   jobs.

aV Economic development and community engagement  are  university - wide effort s .   We are proud that  ev ery college  on campus, along with  many other units of  the university,  are   engaged in the hands - on  process of economic engagement and community development.   One of the core strengths of NC State is  our  culture of engagement.   21 NC State faculty   are members of the prestigious National Academies.   Faculty  are  evaluated in six realms of responsibility that recognize and reward this important part of our  mission .

With the goal of creating broad awareness of these activities and impacts to key publics,  c ommunicators collaborated with engagement units on campus to gather key information, determine  publics and work key messages into larger marketing communications efforts, in addition to promoting  specific stories.    As a result of  this general awareness str  have become  more widely  and more accurately  recognized as a core and vital part of the university ,   rather than simply an outreach effort. Target audiences encompass a broad range of constituents,   including internal publics (faculty, staff and students) ,   alumni ,   board leadership ,   elected officials ,   industry leaders ,   government agency decision makers   and the   general North Carolina public.

aVExcerpt from  President Barack Obama    announc ed   that NC State  would   lead  the  newly formed  Next Generation Power Electronics  National  Manufacturing  Innovation Institute .   (NC State University)     Industry - University Research Partnerships     NC State is consistently  in  the top  10  universities in industry - funded research   for universities without a  medi cal school.   North Carolina  has numerous industry cluster s that support research across the   university ,   and  NC State has  a rich history of encouraging faculty and students to  apply theories and  discoveries  to practical problems.   As a result, NC State  is the   only university in the country to lead  two  NSF E ngineering  R esearch  C enter s,  both of  which require a 2 - 1 industry match .  NC State   was  also  recently  selected to  lead the Next Generation Power Electronics National Manufacturing Innovation  Institute , with a  required $70 mill i on dollar match of industry support.    
p817
aV NC State is engaged in five NSF - funded Industry University Cooperative Research Centers,  which bring   federal and industrial funding together to  address   a p articular research challenge.  NC State also  was  selected as the home for the Lab for Analytical Sciences, a $60 million NSA re search effort that   involve s   collaborative projects with security, analytics and other information technology companies.   NC State is  the catalyst for many smaller industry - eng aged centers, institutes and consortia across the breadth of  our institution.   In addition to being a part of many industry/university centers and projects, NC State is  also continually improving the ways  in which  the campus interacts with industry,  such as   the recent  creation of  the Office of Research, Innovation and Economic Development . This move puts , research,  technology transfer, industry partnerships,  the  Centennial Campus Partnership Office, an industry  concierge office, a proposal development office , research administration (pre - award) and thirteen  multidisciplinary centers and institutes into the same organization.   This allows the university to better  manage the university partnership process, from small - scale collaborations to large,  strategic  mult i year   partnerships.
p818
aV Another way NC State is innovating in industry research partnerships is by creating a master research  agreement for companies that includes streamlined  intellectual property  licensing and patent terms ,   and implementing those agreement s with significant industry partners.   The  agreement  template is  designed for companies that seek a substantial, long - te rm relationship with NC State.  On the basis of  a  similar template, Eastman Chemical  selected us  as their strategic research partner, init ially committing a  $10 million inve stment in research at NC State  from 2013   to  2017, with projects selected by a joint  steering team.   In the first 18 months of the partnership, Eastman has supported more than $6 million in  research across  six   colleges and  is likely to exceed the $10 million figure over the first  five   years of the  agreement.   Nike also recently established a master research agreement with NC State ,   and several  others are in the negotiation process.

aVCentennial Campus   and Centennial Biomedical Campus also contribute    the area of industry research partnerships.   These  part s   of the campus allow companies to be co - located  with NC State faculty, research laboratories and facilities ,   facilitat ing  daily interactions among students,  faculty and external partners.   Centennial Campus   allows the university to maximize physical and  intellectual engagement with companies as well as nonprof it   organizations  and  government  agencies .  NC State has also stro ngly supported cooperative research relationships in the form of centers and  institutes that involve research, testing and collaborative relationships with companies. In addition to  the large number of such organizational relationships, there has been nota ble success in maintaining  center - based programs that may last for years  even decades. The university boasts 60+  interdisciplinary research centers across a number of disciplines.

Increasingly, we recognize that we are more innovative and more  productive in our engagement efforts when we have acces s to timely, accurate and reliable data and  information to monitor and respond to opportunities for collaboration and innovation. Yet at this time  our ability to understand the nature and impact of our engaged work and to monitor the factors that  influence   opportunities for future community engagement and economic competitiveness is limited.

aVLike many institutions of higher education, NC State is a highly decentralized institution. While we  believe that this positions us to be more adaptive and innovative , we also recognize that our capacity to  continuously assess progress toward community engagement and economic development goals varies  across each college, department and unit. This situation was recently highlighted in the findings and  recommendations se t forth in the final report of the NC State Benchmarking Economic Development  Impacts Task Force in January 2010 ,   which  called for the following:     1.    effectively and efficiently account for and measure the range of accomplishments in  engagement, program outcomes leading to behavior change, and the societal i mpacts that  affect communities, companies and organizations.

Durin g   the self - assessments conducted for our 2014 SACS Reaffirmation process and   for the submission  of the application for the 2015 Carnegie Foundation for the Advancem ent of Teaching, we also  recognized a lack of accessibility and consistency in our approach to data and information management.  Not only is this situation confounding our ability to report and analyze our collaborative work and to  measure the impact of the se efforts, but the time lag inherent in the collection of traditional data  sources means our analysis is consistently retrospective, lagging the current reality that we are trying to  analyze. This situation demands a focus on making better use of computin g power and data architecture  systems to access and manipulate the data and information we  have  at our fingertips. Following best  practices for knowledge management,  our  vision for the work ahead   is  outlined in  the  following  table .   The long - term goal of th e proposed work is to demonstrate the centrality of engagement as a  contributing factor to the effectiveness and viability of higher education and economic development.  Led by the Office of Outreach and Engagement (with support from senior administration),   this work will  enhance our ability to measure societal trends and needs and serve as a catalyst for leveraging and  securing resources to add value to the  people and communities we serve.

It   describes the specific investments re quired to implement the  improvements and achieve the goals   demonstrating that  well - planned stewardship can  facilitate   effective transformation.

As mentioned previously, t he New Jersey Innovation Institute (NJII) was established by President  Bloom and the Board of Trustees to  continue to grow academic and  applied   research .

The BET will work to develop a plan to increase the growth  of  industry - sponsored support.     For a variety of historic reasons, many  NJ   manufacturers  do no t have   the resources and facilities  to invest in critically needed R&D.

NMSU   explored   economic development and research  organizatio  and  assessments of best practices at other public  universities throughout the country, which led NMSU to the APLU IEP Designation and Award  Program. NMSU explored best practices from each of the universities designated in the   first IEP  cohort, paying particular attention to administrative organization. The culmination of this analysis  resulted in the establishment of the Office of the Vice President for Economic Development  (OVPED) as a full - time administrative office in early   2014,   its first action to apply for the APLU IEP  designation.     Previously a part - time unit associated with the College of Business and Arrowhead Center,   embarked on  the IEP self - assessment   with goals of establishing a baseline understanding of    hout the state.  NMSU conducted its self - study and participated in the 2014 APLU IEP cohort, but was not selected  to receive the designation. In August of the same year, NMSU joined the 2015 IEP cohort  determined to revise and re - submit its application for  the APLU IEP designation. As a result of  
p1003
aVNMSU, APLU - IEP   Application     Page  2   of  27   various  self - study processes over the last year, the institution has gained greater perspective of its  strengths and weakness, subsequently initiating economic engagement planning efforts, policy  changes, and new pa rtnership opportunities impacting economic prosperity throughout the state.    W hen NMSU began this self - assessment  it had a strong grasp of its role in innovation  through its Arrowhead Center. Innovation is understood as the process of creating or reimagini ng  novel ideas, processes, products, or services, and moving them into areas of useful application  which meet public need. However, the idea of economic prosperity began to change as NMSU  simultaneously worked on the Carnegie Community Engagement Classific ation (CCEC) , championed  by many of the IEP mentors in 2014 . Innovation requires and is requisite to prosperity, but not in  the traditional sense of success in material terms and flour ishing financially.  Combined, economic  development and community e ngage ment nurture community prosperity, measured economically,  socially, and culturally.  Economic prosperity in this way is integrated into  Vision 2020  strategic plan, r ealizable through public - private partnerships and the reach of individuals.   1.2   Process Experience
p1004
aVIn 2013, resultant of a mixture of administrative changes, strategic planning efforts, and  internal assessment, NMSU experienced significant changes in its ins titutional approach to  economic development. For the first time   Economic Development and Community Engagement    were incorporated as institutional strategic goals, and OVPED considered a full time job.  The APLU  IEP 2014 cohort provided a pathway to conduc t a base assessment of institutional economic  development efforts and their   overall   alignment with the goals of Vision 2020.

The surveys were distributed internally and  externally among 941 stakeholders, with an average response ra te of ten percent. Qualitative  thematic coding was utilized to extract major themes from the open - ended responses. The  remaining survey questions, rated on an agreement scale, were analyzed to identify areas of  accomplishment and growth/improvement.    Utili zing aspects of the CCEC template and the New Metrics, 25 interviews were held with  representatives from various colleges, departments and units across campus. These face - to - face  meetings proved to be an integral part of the self - assessment , and the develo pment of application  narrative,  providing    workforce development, and overall contributions to regional economic and community prosperity.     In November 2014, NMSU hosted an Economic Dashb oard assessment workshop. External  stakeholders from 20 counties throughout the state attended this two day workshop. The workshop  identified regional strengths and areas of improvement for each county in New Mexico and ways in  which NMSU can better assist   them.    base jobs, for others economic gardening.  On campus it is a mix of theory and application.   Embedded in this conclusion is the need for mutually beneficial relatio nships where reciprocity is  evident through communication, partnerships, ideas, and innovation.  Overall this process has  encouraged NMSU to look more broadly at its economic engagement activities.

Consistent with Vision 2020, the OVPED, CES, and Deans started out to draft an Extension and  Outreach, and Service  quickly renamed Com munity Engagement   (CE)  Plan in fall 2014. The  CE  Plan aligns with each institutional strategic goal, but largely speaks to addressing community  needs, and fostering prosperity through reciprocal engagement, as defined by Carnegie and Kellogg.  The OVPED  bol sters   public - private partnership s , most recently in the development of the  Burrell  College of Osteopathic Medicine   (BCOM), a private school partnering with NMSU to support   workforce development and   medically underserved c ommunities.    Development through engagement is an ongoing process. NMSU is continually reevaluating  and assessing impacts of its economic engagement enterprise. In 2010 the OIA, conducted a survey     efforts . A comparative analy sis of the surveys conducted in 2010  and 2014 suggests the institution has made progress toward achieving its economic development  goals; however, there is always room for growth and improvement.     1.4   Economic Engagement Planning    he APLU IEP and CCEC  self - assessments   influenced fundamental  changes to its strategic plan. These changes were spearheaded by the shared vision of university  administration to place an emphasis on community centric economic engagement.    NMSU supports   econo mic and workforce development, facilitate s   community engagement across  the institution, and  communicates   achievements to all stakeholders. These objectives are realized  through cross - campus planning efforts aimed at streamlining research commercialization,  cultivating partnerships, aligning academic programs with regional economic opportunities,  implementing   a  CE   Plan, and  implementing a   marketing plan .  The se objectives   are  changing the  institution   and  align   with areas of strength and improvement identified in the IEP self - assessment.

aVComplimenting   these institutional planning efforts, economic development planning is  undertaken individually by the O  academic units. In 2015 NMSU embarked on an institutional system model, incorporating all 4  branch campu ses under direct leadership of the  NMSU Chancellor. In doing so, the administration   identified   ec on omic development as a s ystem - wide goal. The OVPED has begun working closely  with  the NMSU System and various units across campus to align and implement economic  development initiatives  that   cultivate fortified state - wide economic prosperity.    Support for    invests its own seed capital, transferring funds from Fixed & Administrative recovery. That, plus  the  outcome of i ts efforts, attracts attention  f rom   the  State   Legislature. The top pr iorities for Research  & Public Service Project (RPSP) funding requests from the New Mexico legislature for FY 2015 were   development and financial literacy progra m, and K - 12 STEM education programs run  collaboratively through Arrowhead Center, the Colleges of Arts and Sciences and Education.  Those  funds help meet the ever - increasing matching requirement for federal grants, such as those from  the  EDA .  Perhaps the  greatest return on investment does not come from state nor even federal  funds, but rather from private foundations likewise committed to development through  engagement.   1.5   Promotion and Communication     NMSU  must   reach two audiences, one on and one off camp us.   The self - assessment targeted  internal (i.e., NMSU administrators, faculty, and staff), and external (e.g., alumni and regional

aVNMSU, APLU - IEP   Application     Page  7   of  27   businesses). The results revealed that communication of economic development initiatives at NMSU  was adequate but could  imp rove upon   communicating its message of development through  engagement.  The need to increase effective communication strategies across the insti tution was   2014   Employee Satisfaction Survey .   In response, t  Council (PCC) was founded and a marketing budget committed to developing communicatio n  strategies for greater connectivity with internal and external stakeholders. In collaboration with the  PCC, the OVPED, and University Communications (UComm) are working to move this initiative  forward.

Arrowhead Center has  also expanded communication through visual media with  Arrowhead Productions , utilizing the   promotional videos   for  NMSU,  Arrowhead Center, and their entrepreneurial partners . Through the Community Engagement  Council, the OVPED and UComm  are working   to develop monthly e -  annual magazine  Panorama , and have secured space in two state newspapers to   regularly   feature   s CES in collaboration with UComm has  developed a monthly report highlighting all extension and outreach stories featured in regional  press outlet and distributed to internal stakeholders.    In recognizing the value of face - to - face meetings conducted during   the self - assessment,   the  OVPED has and will continue to meet with and listen to stakeholders to identify relevant assets for  promoting economic engagement and to position the OVPED as a point of entry to services and  resources. This information gathering  process will also include meetings with various focus groups  throughout the state to listen to the needs of the greater community and to design an effective  strategy for maintaining economic prosperity and continued growth.

aVAs they expand, NMSU must explore best practices and assess the impacts and progress of  its programs. Throughout the IEP and related processes, NMSU frequently looked to its peer  institutions, CICEP mentors, and members of the IEP communit y to learn best practices. Strong  working relationships were founded with Auburn and Montana State University, reciprocally  sharing information about our collective experiences with the APLU IEP and Carnegie application s ,  and engagement generally. Beyond those discussions, we gleaned notions from Michigan State and  Purdue initially discussed during the IEP community calls. More recently, dialogue with Marquette  University is helping the institution develop specialized dat a collection and reporting methods  regarding community and economic engagement using Digital Measures. Collectively, lessons  learned allow NMSU to address the need for more inclusive metrics identified in the IEP self - assessment, recommended by the Carnegi e Foundation and noted by the Regents as an area for  improvement.

aVGlobally competitive workforces, fostered by public - private partnerships, are vital for  economic development and represent  one  of the most striking examples of replicable initiatives at  NMSU. The Arrowhead Research Park is home to three very uniqu e schools all founded in public - private partnerships.  As a collaborative member of   the  Bridge of Southern New Mexico , a non - profit  comprised of 29 community partners, NMSU played a key role in the development  of two Early  College High Schools (ECHS). These ECHS provide students dual credit and work - based - learning  opportunities, support workforce preparedness ,   and resulted in 100% retention and graduation of  their first class. The   unique   community planning model   behind the schools was adopted by the  Governor, culminating in a K - to - Gray  Workforce Preparedness   initiative and the establishment of  11 ECHS throughout the state. NMSU has also adapted this com munity planning model  to  establish  the  BCOM   at NMSU, which will admit its first class in 2016.    2.0    Summary of Accomplishments   (Word Count: 1996/2000)

aVNMSU, APLU - IEP   Application     Page  20   of  27   3.0   Growth/Improvement Plan   (Word Count: 1630/2000)   The  self - assessments   revealed a number of areas on which  NMSU  must focus to improve  its   performance in economic  development and community engagement.  One set of these foci is internal to NMSU: the need to design and  implement faculty p romotion  and tenure standards that take   into account work dedicated to economic development and community engagement; maintaining a  comprehensive, campus - wide tracking mechanism for economic development and community engagement activities; allocating budget to  support these activities; effectin g more efficient means of communicating about these activities and opportunities within the on - campus  community; and further advancing a cross -  partnerships with ext ernal stakeholders: the need to implement more efficient procedures for securing contracts, licenses, and other  agr eements with industry partners;   communications concerns such as the need to designate an initial point of contact for industry; to  develop an d maintain user -  linkages and collaboration between faculty members and companies; to work with the community to identify actionable economic  growth  an d engagement priorities; and to  expand    startup businesses.     3.1   Promote Stronger Partnerships   NMSU maintains productive partnerships with a wide range of constituent  relationships with national laboratories, military installations, and other federal entities link NMSU not only to the innova tive research  emerging from these partnerships, but also connections with the state  The self - assessment recognized the need for  NMSU  to  facilitate stronger relationships with its internal counterparts to strengthen and maximize external partnerships .  Working

aVNMSU, APLU - IEP   Application     Page  21   of  27   alongside business and community  leaders,   NMSU can serve i n a leadership role to help and identify areas for economic growth and  engagement. Establishing stronger  partnerships  for economic engagement  will  lead to   increased employment, accelerated businesses,   and  new approaches to innovation.     The self - assessment also recognized a need to find more efficient procedures for working with industry. These include  streamlining the procedures for contracts, technology licenses, and other agreements for products or services. NMSU has alrea dy created  st andardized technology license agreements  to help fast track the commercialization process.    To improve internal relationships, meetings between  OVPED and Colleges will provide the necessary data and information to  ensure the best possible use of existing r esources.   Promoting faculty research and expertise to regional companies will allow for the  creation of new partnerships for industry seeking market solutions.  This will allow NMSU to  establish  and capitalize on  mutually  beneficial  relationships with inte rnal and external partners.   To  begin facilitating   this process NMSU has designed a searchable  faculty  expertise database , showcasing   faculty research interest and specialization to promote innovation,  collaboration and connectivity   across  campus and with external stakeholders.   3. 2   Improve  Communication   to Stakeholders   Planning documents and survey  instruments identified the need for effective communication with all stakeholders in order to  learn about c oncerns, guide solutions, and identify opportunities for growth. Two - way communication nurtures mutually beneficial  relationships that meet the needs of both the university and the larger community. The communication flow needs to begin from   the  inside - out , communicating in a way that inspires action from others.   The OVPED   through its Strategic   P lan identifies   communication as  one of several keys to success necessary to meet the goals of economic development at NMSU.

aVNMSU, APLU - IEP   Application     Page  22   of  27   Lines of communication must be opened an d maintained with all stakeholders in state economic development, both internal and  external partners and others in need of resources and services. Listening to   the   NMSU  community , industry and   government   representatives , and New Mexico    residents will pr ovide insight into problems and aid in providing solutions from existing and emerging  resources.  Establishing structured communication mechanisms am ong NMSU S ystem partners will allow understanding of the ways in  which the structure and function of variou s offices and departments overlap and how best to facilitate communication, share expectations,  and define compatible objectives.   Online access through the  OVPED website   provide s   one means of communication with  internal and external stakeholders. A  combination of online and face - to - face communication will be utilized for those seeking economic development assistance. Methods of  communication will include NMSU county extension agents, listening tours, conferences,   and small group interactions with faculty, staff  and students , as well as a structure marketing plan as mandated by Vision 2020 and developed through the PCC .    3. 3   Directives and Incentives for Innovation   In order to nurture and advance innovation, NMSU m ust create incentives for changes to  curriculum, faculty  promotion and  tenure,   enrollment, retention, graduation rates,  and other areas to promote economic prosperity. The self - assessment process revealed  that NMSU has organized and operates many incredible programs related to that promote engagement and economic prosperity.  However, the process has also revealed that inter nally NMSU can make more concerted efforts to unify economic engagement efforts   y by  individual colleges, departments or university   programs and division.  University administration has recognized the need to focus  attention on the development of a cross - campus directive of innovation. To achieve this goal, and in conjunction with the findings of the  
p1048
aVNMSU, APLU - IEP   Application     Page  23   of  27   IEP self - study, the core team has  identified four major internal objectives for growth and improvement. Additionally many of these goals  align with overall institutional goals  introduced   by the Provost   at Spring Convocation in 2014 .    The combined self - assessments   of the IPE and CCEC indica ted that NMSU is offering an extensive array of courses with  experiential learning components that address community needs. However ,   there is no campus wide system for promoting and tracking  the impact of these programs. NMSU will work to set a standardize d course number   or code   designating   service or experiential learning  opportunities for students. Additionally in an effort to expand Innovative and Entrepreneurial Curriculum the OVPED  is working establish   an interdisciplinary internship program. This prog ram will combine both graduate and undergraduate students on interdisciplinary  teams working on community related projects. This program is designed to inspire innovative problem solving in an open labora tory  space that will foster collaborative idea shari ng.  Through these initiatives NMSU strives to offer the most work - based - learning programs  of any institution in the state.    Th e   self - assessment   showed on many levels that NMSU needs to address ways to measure and track the impact of its efforts in  economic   development   and community engagement. Measurement and tracking systems must be implemented at many different levels.  Coupled with the standardization of experiential learning course numbers, data on enrollment and outcomes will also be collec ted. The  Prov ost  has   implement ed   an annual review of NMSU co - curricular and extracurricular programs that have community  engagement/development components.  Through the work of the CE Plan, the Community Engagement Council, the Office of the Provost,  OIA and the OVPED a re developing a system of metrics using of Digital Measures, and data collection from institutional reporting systems,  that will capture the volume and impacts of faculty, staff, and student participation in community and economic engagement ac tivities.

As the revision of promotion and tenure policies is done through each individual college, the OVEPD  has worked with  leadership from the Faculty Senate to   push forward discussions  concerning   these types of revisions   forward .  Since NMSU c onducted the  IEP self - assessment  the Faculty Senate and the Office of the Provost began reconsidering  P&T  policy.  T hese two units have  agreed to  consider and explore the integration of community engagement into P&T policy at the institutional level. In fur therance of faculty  recognition, the OVPED working with the Office of Advancement, has proposed and  secured an endowment for   an annual award that  recognizes faculty participation in economic and community engagement activities .   The self - study process also  revealed that the OVPED must focus more attention on leveraging its resources among its internal and  external communities.  Many of the faculty responded in the opened questions included in the IPE survey that they did not fee l well  informed about economic   engagement opportunities. To increase awareness of economic engagement opportunities, the OVPED has been  attempting  and continues to inform faculty of economic opportunities by holding a series of lunches with deans and department heads.  These lunches not   only communicate individual opportunities in economic ventures but also how departmental entrepreneurship can  lead to an additional sources of resource stewardship and funding opportunities. The most effective example of departmental  entrepreneurship at N MSU is the newly developed College of Education Economic Enterprise Inc. (CEEEI). CEEEI is an economic  enterprise run and owned by the College of Education that will transform their research into applicable goods and services th rough their  audiology lab  wh ich   open ed in March   201 5.

aV    NMSU must reach out to underserved communities, underrepresented populations of prospective students, and underperforming  current students.  Native American peoples are the pinnacle of that list, but not alone.    Twenty percent of the population  of the state of  New Mexico  lives below poverty, a third more than the national average.  Poverty rates for children, women, and single - parent household  are far worse.   As an institution, NMSU views these groups as  the foun dation of a globally   competitive workforce with whom it must  engage .    Of those who begin to make out of the cycle of poverty by graduating from high school and make it to NMSU, only seventy perce nt  will make it past the first year.  Forty percent will grad uate in 6 years.  All the foundation of malaise, both culturally and economically.

Within a 45 -  three mid - sized river towns (Rockford, Aurora and Elgin), struggling to recreate prosperity from  the ruins of a manufacturi ng - base collapse.  Moving further west towards the Mississippi, the  landscape changes again.  This territory is dotted with very poor communities, old towns with  declining populations and high concentrations of elderly people who grew up there and  probably   will never leave.  With greatly reduced earnings from manufacturing centers and very  little high - paying employment, these communities struggle with an associated inability to retain  working - age residents and a parallel inability to support high - quality pu blic school systems for  the children of those who remain.

aV Enhanced emergency care, remote diagnostics and better access to medical specialists will soon  be available at rural hospitals and clinics throughout Illinois, thanks to an innovative, NIU - led  partnership known as the  Illinois Rural Health Network (IRHN) .  Funded by a $21 million federal  grant, IRHN is connecting 88 locations across the state to a lightning - fast broadband network.   That enhanced speed means health provid ers in rural areas can consult with specialists,  monitor patients in remote locations, transmit and receive very large files such as MRI scans     all in a matter of minutes or seconds.  In many part of Illinois, patients have no local access to  specialists  in critical fields such as radiology, cardiology, and neurology.  IRHN will enable  participating hospitals to dramatically expand the menu of medical services they can offer, and  will significantly improve emergency care at hospitals in remote parts of the   state.  Without  access to a broadband network, for example, a typical CT scan would take five days to transmit,  versus just minutes with a high - speed connection.     Not content to simply expand broadband access, NIU has recently moved into a second stage of   digital evangelism:  teaching partners how to realize the full promise of high - speed Internet.   One such initiative involves helping 1,300 primary care physicians across the state learn how to  make the best possible use of electronic health records.  With   more than $9 million in federal  funding, the project presents webinars and case studies for doctors, as well as health  informatics training for staff.    with all partners is shifting to deve  potential.

aVCenter for P - 20 Engagement   (P - 20 Center) is unique in its focus on  coordinated campus - wide efforts to connect external partners such as schools with people and  resources across five colleges and more than twenty of fices, centers, and institutes at NIU.   Such coordination may seem like an obvious strategy, but the P - 20 initiatives at NIU  represented a new way of thinking about the typical organizational problem of the left hand  not knowing what the right hand is doin g. In the past, individual faculty members arranged  projects with teachers in area schools. In schools with large, high - needs populations, NIU  sometimes conducted three or more projects simultaneously in one building, quite unaware of  each other. This scat tershot approach caused frustration among school administrators, a sense  of exploitation among teachers, and roadblocks for faculty seeking partners.

aV18     o   The Illinois Manufacturing Excellence Center (IMEC) is a non - profit economic  development organization, funded in part by the National Institute of Standards  and Technology  -   Manufacturing Extension Partnership, the Illinois Departm ent  of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, and by fees for services paid by Illinois  manufacturers. NIU is home to one of the eleven Illinois office locations.  Together, IMEC and NIU are creating a competitive grants program that funds  IMEC - NIU - Industry par tnerships focused on manufacturing innovation and  regional economic development.

aVo   NIU has become an active member of the University Industry Demonstration  Project (UIDP), participating in development of model agreements and  sponsoring an online networkin g opportunity in conjunction with a regional  meeting.   o   NIU has become an affiliate of Chicago Innovation Mentors, an entrepreneurship  boot camp that supports and trains university - based and local innovators  through the use of mentor teams.
p1145
aVThe metrics and   benchmarks used to measure growth and improvement are compatible with  the data routinely collected by the NIU OSP, and consistent with the recommendations of both  Vision 2020 and the APLU metrics projects:
p1146
aV  Faculty research productivity is by measuring sp onsored research activity, including:  proposals submitted to competitive programs (units = # proposals submitted and $  value of proposals); total awards received via competitive grants and contracts (units = #  awards; $ value of awards); competitive federa l awards (units = # awards; $ value); state  and local awards (units = # awards; $ value of awards); corporate and foundation  awards (units = # awards initiated; $ value of awards);  total research expenditures ($  value).
p1147
aV  Industry collaboration is assesse d by tracking both the number and the dollar value of  contracts, consortia and affiliation agreements that include an industry partner, as well  as the dollar value of industry - sponsored R&D.
p1148
aV Faculty innovation and entrepreneurship are measured by tracking   the numbers of  invention disclosures, patent applications, licenses/options, and start - up formation.
p1149
aVThe major barriers to implementation of this growth and improvement plan are related to: the  current fiscal climate (state and federal); the staffing an d resource base of the TTO; and the  expectations of internal and external stakeholders.     Defining and Documenting Success: Leveraging Regional Centers     The three NIU centers (Rockford, Hoffman Estates, and Naperville) and the University Center of  Lake County (a multi - university partnership which NIU helps manage) are state - of - the - art  facilities that offer multimedia learning environments for academic clas ses and professional  programs and full - service daytime conferences. Scenic Lorado Taft Field Campus is both a

With  online learning and virtual meetings extendin g the reach of many higher education  institutions, NIU must rethink the value proposition associated with these bricks - and - mortar  facilities.  To this end,

The CICEP  New Metrics framework will be used as the basis for developing measureable outcomes for  each sub - regional development plan to ensure accountability a nd transparency.
p1154
aV Resources, follow - through, and alignment are the three top barriers to success.  Resources to  conduct the center profiles and staff the engagement processes are needed.  OEIT has  committed to this in its strategic plan and will engage t he entire institution in this process.   Following through to ensure that each sub - regional development plan is being addressed will  require a multi - year, institution - wide commitment by NIU, and President Baker must actively  reinforce the long - term importan ce of this effort. Institutional alignment is needed to ensure   require increased coordination and strong internal partnerships  -   strategies that are already  being s upported by OEIT and will be ramped up to support this improvement plan.

aVThe Ohio State University  APLU Innovation and Economic Prosperity Award  August 19, 2013   1  INTRODUCTION  The Ohio State University proudly submits its application for the APLU Innovation and  Economic Prosperity Award.   At Ohio State, the phrases \ufb01innovation\ufb02 and \ufb01economic prosperity\ufb02 mean  more than creating something new  \u0152 they mean capitalizing on the talent, tools and passions of students,  researchers, entrepreneurs, business leaders and alumni to make life better for  Ohioans.  The Ohio State   submission reflects this definition, as it includes stories about  working with industry leaders to determine  workforce needs and tailoring high school and university curriculum to fulfill those needs.  In addition,   Ohio State is im pacting the state by  providing an ultra -fast network connection through fiber -optic cables  to Ohio colleges and universities, public and private K -12 schools, hospitals and state and local  governments.   These stories are highlighted in the attached three c ase studies: Ohio\u2122s 100 Gigabit  Network, IBM Data Analytics and The Metro School.
p1185
aV   The attached packet  also  includes a growth improvement plan on three fronts: tailoring current  program curricul um and creating new curriculum to fit industry needs,  supporting university  entrepreneurs through commercialization of research , and capitalizing on the Ohio State alumn i base for  business development .  It addition to  identifying these goals , a logic model indicates the activities,  resources and metrics used to  reach and measure success .   PROCESS EXPERIENCE  In  April  2012, the Office of Research  at The Ohio State University  sponsored a retreat with  college deans, research deans and external industry representatives to explore economic development   metrics  that we re meaningful for the central Ohio region . Eleven metrics  were selected  that fall under  three categories: relationships with industry, developing the regional and national workforce, and   knowledge and incubation and acceleration programs.   This retreat represented part of the APLU CICEP  strategy  to develop more effective measures of higher education\u2122s contributions to the regional economy.   The Office of Institutional Research and Planning has been surveying  internal and external stakehold ers  on these metrics.  In addition,  in August 2012,  the university hired Dr. Blake Thompson as Vice President

aVThe Ohio State University  APLU Innovation and Economic Prosperity Award  August 19, 2013   2  for Economic and Workforce Development; he is responsible for coordinating and expanding the  University's significant ongoing efforts in economic  development and workforce readiness.  To prepare for the Innovation and Economic Prosperity Award, university executives, including  leadership from Research, Technology Commercialization and Licensing, Industry Liaison, and the   region's incubator/accelerato r, reviewed the data collected by Institutional Research and Planning and   determined which areas to highlight for the case studies and areas for improvement.
p1187
aV  ECONOMIC ENGAGEMENT ENTERPRISE  The Ohio State University defines economic engagement not as  a direction or initiative  but rather  a mantra of  the  university. Not only is Ohio State the largest university in the state  - and one of the largest employers  - but it is counted on for the flow of new talent throughout all of  Ohio. This talent will create  the new technologies of tomorrow, fill  the many jobs needed to run  this economy and will be counted on for investing back into the state. For Ohio State, economic  engagement is tied into every single aspect of the university.  The Office of Economic & Work force Development touches  nearly  every part of the  university. Internally, constituents view this office as build ing  more public -private partnerships  across all disciplines. Externally, stakeholders see this office as a front -door for doing business  with t he university. Ohio State is always looking for better ways and more validated leads on   potential business opportunities that benefit the university. For each current project, there are two   more right behind it that the university should be exploring and v alidating.   The office has three  major functions:  1. Align with Columbus 2020, the regional economic development authority  2. Build stronger public -private relationships with industry partners  3. Manage the planning and development of the campus research park  
p1188
aVThe Ohio State University  APLU Innovation and Economic Prosperity Award  August 19, 2013   3  ECONO MIC ENGAGEMENT PLANNING  The university will build upon strengths and identify areas of improvement based on  ideas from the economic development advisory board. This board, comprised of industry leaders  across multiple sectors, will advise  on the major goal s of the office. This board is necessary  because the economic contributions from the university are far greater than what the university   personnel sees on a daily basis in the marketplace. As Ohio State\u2122s reach grows globally, it needs   thought leaders who  can harness this growth and direct the university into the future . As big university initiatives are created and matured, this advisory board will tie in  its  role in economic development. For example, business related to shale gas is expanding in   Eastern  Ohio. As this momentum grows in the state, the university is looking for ways to include   it in its mission with regards to education, collaborat ive  research, and industry partnerships. The  role of the advisory board is to help find the right industry partners  - wherever they may be in the  world  - and navigate these partnerships into campus via the research park or into academics and  research. This bo ard will also help manage the budget for the office to ensure long -term  sustainability. Revenue will come in many forms, but mainly fundraising, tenant leases in the   research park and industry grants and  projects.  Economic engagement areas are really focus ed around not only the quantity of industry  partnerships, but also the quality of these partnerships. For example, although Ohio State ranks   third in industry sponsored research in the country, it is still developing the research park and has   not fully opt imized these relationships, both financially and research -wise. Ohio State not only  needs more partnerships that will lead to more internships, jobs, research, and dollars coming   into the university it needs to maximize existing relationships and find new  leads to move it   forward.  
p1189
aVThe Ohio State University  APLU Innovation and Economic Prosperity Award  August 19, 2013   4  PROMOTION AND COMMUNICATION  The university\u2122s strategic communications about economic engagement are targeted to  four different groups: Business Partners, Regional Economic Development Organizations,  Internal Stakeholders, and Acad emic/Civic/Non -Profit Organizations.   The university\u2122s approach towards its business partners  involves  the Office of Economic  Development. This team looks at the relationships the university owns and carefully devises   strategies to engage those partners;  these methods usually are focused around building and  maturing the relationship with regards to a research or academic collaboration. For example, the   university has a partnership with Huntington Bank. As Ohio State develops new initiatives, new   charities,  and more ideas on building upon the existing relationship, the Office of Economic   Development engages Huntington monthly to discuss new growth opportunities. This   communication method is more of an in -person, one -on-one conversation, as are most of our  business partner engagements.   But during those  conversations,  subject matter expert s are  brought on  as new avenues for growth  are determined . One example is how  Ohio State  integrate s prospective  students  to the university into the Huntington partnership. As  that  continues to become a conversation piece,  Ohio State  will invite the student leaders on campus,  as well as  leadership  from  the  Office of Student Life to provide ideas on how better to promote  the  partnership  Communication with regional economic develo pment organizations is also the focus of  the Office of Economic Development. The university aligns its vision with the vision of the   regional organizations, as they all work together to bring more jobs and build more   collaborations for the university and t he region. In fact, these regional organizations often rely on  the university to help lead recruitment,  ret ention , and  expansion  efforts , as it sometimes comes  
p1190
aVThe Ohio State University  APLU Innovation and Economic Prosperity Award  August 19, 2013   5  down to the university\u2122s appetite to build a stronger research partnership with a specific  compa ny.    Ohio State relies on these regional organizations to relay communications to the  neighborhoods and communities;  the Office of Economic Development engages these regional  organizations through the use of a CRM tool to ensure consist information is dis tributed  statewide.    For internal stakeholders, such as colleges and departments that include faculty,  staff and  students, the university\u2122s central communications department will promote any activities going  on with economic engagement. This is done to en sure the right internal stakeholders are  identified in a timely fashion.   The university announces engagements to internal stakeholders  only when all details are finalized to allow the university to better promote activities without   delivering too much new s at one time. Communication is done through email, and sometimes  through the internal campus newspaper.  In addition, the Office of Economic Development holds   various town hall meetings to engage the campus community in new engagements.  ADVANCING UNIVERSI TY ECONOMIC ENGAGEMENT  One of the university\u2122s past presidents coined this phrase \ufb01Ohio State is the economic  engine for the state\ufb02. This phrase resonates with all people and organizations in the state because   of the size and breadth of Ohio State. This  university not only provides much of the workforce in   the state, but also supports its partnerships with businesses across the state to promote their   growth and innovation. Most families in Ohio have an Ohio State grad, or know someone close   that has been  a grad. The same goes for companies, many of which have done some sort of   project or charity with Ohio State. As such, Ohio State has been, and will continue to be, a leader   in economic engagement in the state.  
p1191
aVThe Ohio State University  APLU Innovation and Economic Prosperity Award  August 19, 2013   6  The university is also a leader with the othe r colleges and universities in the state. Ohio  State does not view any of these organizations as competitors, but instead partners in this  educational mission for the state of Ohio. Colleges and universities work together on different  projects aimed to pro mote economic development across the state. One example is the Preferred  Pathway program, in which  students attend and graduate from Columbus State Community  College for their two -year degree, and will automatically roll over into Ohio State to finish a  bachelor\u2122s degree if they choose to do so. This shows Ohio State\u2122s commitment to all students,  no matter their background or where they are in the academic career.  Ohio State\u2122s stance on its role in economic engagement is that the university is a  contributor  and partner in efforts to build innovation and sustainability for students of today and  tomorrow. That stance applies to the university\u2122s role in the state of Ohio, in partnerships with  other academic institutions, as well other organizations like CICEP a nd the Committee on  Institutional Cooperation (CIC). The goal of The Ohio State University is to document and   display best practices, so that its stakeholders and partners can adopt these practices and work   together on new opportunities. Ohio State fully s upports the efforts of CICEP and applauds its  efforts in socializing and presenting universities\u2122 economic engagement activities so that we may   all work together to build better opportunities for our stakeholders and communities for many  years to come.

aV Overview  Three years ago, top technology leaders in Columbus,  Ohio, including Cardinal Health and Nationwide,  discussed growing needs in big data analytics and   expressed the need for the region to take a serious  look at bringing an analytics center here. These  companies partnered with Columbus 2020 (the  regional economic development organization), The  Ohio State University, and others to find a partner  that can b uild a world -class facility in Columbus.  Business Situation  As part of the recruitment of IBM to build the Client  Center for Advanced Analytics, IBM needed to make  sure there was appropriate talent in the region to  build out 500 planned jobs in data scienc e-related  positions. There was simply not enough talent that could eventually come in from other sources; the talent  must be created and developing from within the region.  Solution  The Ohio State University, as part of the initial recruitment of IBM, began  a year-long effort to design and  build an undergraduate analytics curriculum in multiple disciplines, including Business, Engineering, and  Math/Statistics. This effort included stakeholders across the university devoting time and energy in multiple  sessio ns to work on a comprehensive curriculum, and not one that is singularly focused on one discipline.  Working together, the stakeholders mapped out the necessary pieces that will make up this new curriculum,   and perhaps the most important aspect was the need  for faculty talent delivering the coursework.  On the cusp of a new curriculum, new ideas and strategies were taken into account in creating an   environment with more clinical faculty who can bring existing, real -world problems to the classroom. Only  this t ype of faculty would be able to start preparing students for the \ufb01hit the ground running\ufb02 expectations  that nation -wide data analytics companies need today. To accomplish this task, the university realized that  strong partnerships with two types of compani es were imperative to the success of this curriculum.  The first type of company is those heavily invested in data analytics, like IBM, SAS, and Google. These types  of companies are the ones looking for research opportunities with the university, as well as  academic  instruction/design and a pipeline to talent. They have the ability to design a curriculum, telling the university  their needs for the graduates that they could hire in the future. They also have the resident knowledge to  come to campus and instru ct a collection of coursework that ties in the company\u2122s core competencies.  The other type of company that the university looked at as a partner, were those that were leaders in their  own right, who had growing data analytics needs in their enterprise, and  were starting to think about their  long -term needs. These companies come from many different industries, including banking and insurance.  Their main focus was a pipeline to talent in order to fill positions, as well as focused coursework in their  
p1194
aVThe Ohio State University  APLU Innovation and Economic Prosperity Award  August 19, 2013   8  industry . For example, tying risk assessment into the curriculum was a highlight for many insurance partners  of the university.  As the initial partner companies began to come into the fold in this initiative, the university started to see  more data analytics compa nies relocating and/or building in Columbus, as news spread of IBM and Ohio  State\u2122s partnership. This has led to the university participating in many recruitment and expansion efforts, as   they worked closely with Columbus 2020. This has already led the suc cessful establishment of a few  companies who will be bring hundreds of additional jobs to the region in the next few years. And as the   university begins offering its first data analytics courses in the Fall of 2013, we think this past year is just the  begi nning for a technology that may end up defining the region.  Benefits  Aside from the increase of jobs, corporate partnerships, and the new curriculum, the university gained the   trust & respect of the region and a top 20 company in the Fortune 500. This is u ltimately what universities are  meant to do; they heed the call of building infrastructure to support big initiatives, and also provide  leadership in bringing multiple parties together to solve the world\u2122s problems. We feel that this past year has  allowed  the university to gain more trust in its role in economic engagement, as it is now looking for new   partners in data analytics, as well as many other disciplines.  In 2011, McKinsey Global Institute released a study that predicts a shortage of talent necessa ry for  organizations to take advantage of big data. \ufb01By 2018, the United States alone could face a shortage of  140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills as well as 1.5 million managers and analysts with the  know -how to use the analysis of big d ata to make effective decisions.\ufb02 It is for this reason that The Ohio  State University is \ufb01all -in\ufb02 in helping provide the next generation of data -driven mindsets who will be leading  the world for the next decade and beyond.    Ron Lovell , Vice President, IBM  Client Center for Advanced Analytics : "The collaboration also  represents a renewed commitment to the community by IBM, Cardinal Health, Huntington Bank,   Nationwide, Limited Brands, Battelle, Information Control Center (ICC) an d The Ohio State University.  Not  only will the IBM Client Center bring 500 new jobs to the Columbus Region over the next three years, it also   will help identify Columbus as the nation\u2122s hub for big data analysis."  Kenny McDonald , Chief Economic Officer , Columbus 2020 : "IBM has made an alytics a priority, which  aligns with the Region\u2122 s strong technology offerings.  The new center will allow IBM to use its full  complement of software and services to attack this issue for clients, and it will also allow the Region to   become a major hub for  analytics, attracting companies from all over the country  \u0152 and even globally  \u0152 to Central Ohio."  Christine A. Poon , Dean of The Fisher College of Business , The Ohio State University : "The future  will be claimed by those able to see critical patterns among  this overwhelming complexity  \u0160 and the  partnership between IBM and Ohio State will ensure that immersive, action -based learning experiences  prepare the next generation of leaders to thrive in this environment.

aVThe Metro School   James  Walton  The  Ohio State University  Walton.153@osu.edu
p1197
aV Metro  Overview  The Metro School is a state of Ohio public STEM (science, technology,  engineering, math) high school open to students from around the state,  although admission is completed through a  lottery system. Students complete  all academic coursework at Metro while remaining eligible to participate in   sports and extra -curricular activities in their district of residence. Metro serves  students who want a personalized learning experience that pre pares them for a  connected world where math, science, and technology are vitally important.  Business Situation  In order for Metro to succeed, it needed to find partners that could not only   provide governance to the school but also help architect a curricul um that can  prepare students for today\u2122s higher education institutions through college   coursework completed prior to Metro graduation.  Solution  Leadership of Metro has been through a public -private partnership led by Ohio State.  Ohio State\u2122s leadership  includes three members of Metro\u2122s governing board, and their contribution has brought a distinctive higher  ed perspective to the table, designing an environment that will prepares these students for the next level in   their education.  By bringing and insisti ng upon a university -facing environment, Metro provides the setting  for the students to accept responsibility for individualized learning,  while also providing a social classroom  atmosphere that delivers the high school grow th experience . The university bo ard members provide  university resources to bridge the gap between high school and college learning.  An original goal from the university was to make sure each student graduated from Metro with a certain level   of college coursework completed. This would no t only motivate these students to apply for college but also  bring a high quality academic experience during their time at Metro.  The university\u2122s representation at Metro  helped  navigate  through various courses and programs at the university to identify t hose courses that would  appeal to and accelerate Metro students. These courses and experiential learning internships range from   chemistry to statistics to physics to scientific leadership.  By providing a robust curriculum to Metro students,  the university  is building a new breed of students who are college  \u0152 and life  \u0152 ready.  In addition to guiding the curriculum design, Ohio State has contributed many elements to the day -to-day  operations and finances of The Metro School. For example, the university house s the school on its research  campus.  In addition, Ohio State helped design the mastery learning philosophy that Metro uses. This school -wide philosophy ensures that a student receives a passing grade of an \ufb01A\ufb02 before they move to the next   course based on  reasoning that students who cannot master a course will most likely do worse in the next  related course because they still haven\u2122t managed the basics. A fter a student receives an "A" grade in a course,   the s tudent then moves immediately into  the next level  in that discipline.   This philosophical distinction faced  
p1198
aVThe Ohio State University  APLU Innovation and Economic Prosperity Award  August 19, 2013   10  initial skepticism, but the credibility and sponsorship of university leadership allowed time for the philosophy  to take hold and become a hallmark of Metro\u2122s success.  Benefits  As we think about th e impact a university has on its community, we cannot overlook its broader role in  education outside of its own institution.  As u niversities today  try  to build more partnerships  and  programs  they  are integrating  K-12 and ot her educational institutions at  an accelerated pace. Some of this has to do  with these universities wanting to help fix lingering problems in public schools, and it  is usually more than  just a financial commitment. Other opportunities focus around collaborated research and innovation. We  are  starting to see more hybrid or co -op primary schools, as well as investments in non -traditional institu tions .   Metro is growing and continues to rely on its university partner in these efforts. Through grants and  sponsorship, Metro has been able to take on more students and more courses, and has recently announced  the expansion of Metro to include middle school.  H owever, these types of expansion require resources, and   the university has become much more involved in bringing its partners  \u0152 companies as well as regional   economic and community development organizations  - as new sponsors who share in Metro\u2122s vision.   Metro has many metrics that measure success, and most of them are in comparison to other schools in the  state. These metrics are continually growing but have already proven that the school is indeed successful in  preparing students (from all backgrounds) f or the colleges and universities of today, reducing any gaps in the  academic preparedness of students going from high school to college. Here are some of those metrics:   Average Composite ACT Score for Metro:  24.5  (Average in Ohio is 21.8, Average in U.S. is 21.1)  Average College Credits Per Student Upon Metro Graduation:  35  credit hours  Percentage of Student Graduation from Metro:  100%  Percentage of Metro Students Accepted To College:  100%  Leaders from the  communi ty, private sector , higher education,  and more have praised The Metro School:  Matthew Habash, Former City Council President, City of Columbus:  "Metro High School affords us  wonderful opportunities for our young people and for our economy. It will help us k eep our best and brightest, our smart capital,  here in Columbus and boost the growth and potential of the 315 Research and Technology Corridor.\ufb02  E. Gordon Gee, Former President, The Ohio State University:  \ufb01As others follow the Metro model, we ought to  be  creating new and different approaches that would further enhance the qualitative growth of public education. So this  demonstration school should continue to be on the cutting edge of opportunity.\ufb02  Recently, the fourth class of students made it through four  years of The Metro School , with virtually  all attending college .  Continuing discussions are focused on long -term funding, capacity, growth  into middle school, and i nnovative  physical environments.   However, external validation of Metro\u2122s  success has been  the replication of the STEM school model to over a dozen new, similar schools in  the state of Ohio, and new STEM schools modeled after Metro in over a dozen other states.

With more than 1,850 miles of fiber -optic backbone,  OARnet provides  more fiber per -capita than any other  state in the nation. OARnet wa s created by  the Ohio  Board of Regents in 1987 and is part of the Regent\u2122s   Ohio Technology Consortium.  Business Situation  OARnet projected that its 10 Gigabits per second  (Gbps) network would face increasing demands from  academic and industry  researchers b ecause, in part, of  the growing importance of \ufb01 Big Data.\ufb02   Solution  State leadership, from the governor to the legislature, as well as Ohio higher education communities and  public and private stakeholders understood the importance of the upgraded network a nd supported the  initiative. Initial discussions regarding the implementation began in October 2011.  With Ohio Governor   John Kasich\u2122s support,  $13.1 million  was awarded on Jan. 30, 2012 , to  incr ease the network capacity  \u0152 in  eight  short months  \u0152 to 100 Gb ps, connecting ten major cities and linking to Internet2\u2122s international 100  Gbps network.   OARnet launched its fiber -optic backbone wit h scalable architecture in 2004. This design  allowed network  engineers to easily upgrade the new, ultra -fast network by  the promised delivery date of December 2012.  For  the 100 Gbps upgrade,  OARnet used equipment from  Cisco and Juniper, who were challenged to quickly  ramp -up to build the bleeding -edge technology.   The project was completed over two phases.  Phase I of the d evelopment increased speeds at connection  points between Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, Dayton and Toledo and was completed in September 2012.   Phase II installations targeted the connection points at Akron, Athens and Youngstown, Wooster and  Portsmouth  and were completed before December 2012.  On Dec. 11, 2012, less than 12 months since the first announcement of OARnet\u2122s enhancement, Governor   Kasich did a ceremonial lighting of the 100 Gbps network.

Benefits  Ohio \u2122s economic future depends on c reating high -tech environments that support next -generation business  applications.  While a few research and education networks have limited deployment of 100 Gbps networks,  Ohio is the first to invest in this gold standard on a statewide scale.   The  100 Gb ps  network will serve as a statewide incubator for public -private partnerships aimed at  commercializing next -generation Internet applications and hardware, attracting new employers with access to  the research network and serving as a platform for developin g new applications in large -scale scientific  research . A Cleveland Plain Dealer  editorial wrote,  \ufb01Ohio is wired for business.  Goodbye Rust Belt, Hello  Nerd -vana.\ufb02  The Columbus Dispatch  similarly wrote, \ufb01 For those inventing the future, Ohio is the hot spot .\ufb02  As one metric of the project\u2122s success, leaders will tally the number of applications vetted through the test -bed being developed as part of the effort. OARnet staff also will gauge the number of upgraded connections   to the backbone being requested by m ember institutions and their partners as they participate in the  development of these big -data apps.  Leaders from the private sector, medical research, higher education, agribusiness and more have praised the   OARnet upgrade an d see limitless opportunities.  Ken Murray, Founder and CEO of Transformatix:  \ufb01When you\u2122re talking about modern health care  research industry  \u0152 medical imaging, genomics, DNA sequencing  \u0152 you\u2122re talking about enormous data sets.    Up until today, the bandwidth didn\u2122t exist to effectively  transmit this volume of information from one point  to another.  One reason we located our new company, BioLinQ, in Ohio, rather than California, is because   Ohio demonstrated the most forward -thinking approach to technology and high -speed innovation.\ufb02  Ray  Leto, President, Total Sim:  \ufb01OARnet\u2122s 100 Gig network upgrade really helps Ohio support its great   research institutions and the cutting -edge industrial innovation that\u2122s happening. \u2013 It\u2122s going to be a great  advantage for recruiting companies to locate in  Ohio. Our business focuses on modeling and simulation for   the automotive industry, and we chose Ohio over the North Carolina Research Triangle because of the  advanced technology infrastructure available here.\ufb02  Ali Rezai, M.D., Director of Center for Neurom odulation, Wexner Medical Center at The Ohio State  University:  \ufb01Ohio\u2122s enhanced 100 Gbps broadband capability will help Ohio be at the cutting edge of  medical innovation and information sharing which will greatly facilitate our patient care, clinical resea rch and  training programs.

aVThe Ohio State University  APLU Innovation and Economic Prosperity Award  August 19, 2013   13  AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:  DEVELO PMENT OF CURRICULUM RESPONSIVE  TO INDUSTRY NEEDS   Businesses and industries in every economic region have a great need for workers with  appropriate training and skills to perform the increasingly complex jobs required for economic success.   In addition to  this need for new graduates to provide the workforce for these industries, many companies  seek programs for in -career education of their existing staff.    In attempting to meet these needs, comprehensive research universities must navigate a fine line.   Universities are not technical schools, at which the focus of educational programs is to train specific skills  for entry -level jobs. Existing technical schools and community colleges fill this niche.  It could be argued  that the education provided by a unive rsity should prepare a student for a career lifetime that might  involve a number of different specific careers; thus, the educational offerings of the university should   impart flexibility, problem -solving skills, and an orientation toward lifelong learning  to best prepare its  students for their working lives.  However, one way in which universities can be a valuable economic  partner to the region and the state is by providing an educational experience that prepares its graduates to  enter the workforce with  a set of skills and educational experiences that  fulfill the market needs   Professionally -oriented graduate degrees can be found at most universities.  Indeed, at Ohio State  there are dozens of professional master\u2122s degrees, including everything from lands cape architecture to  dance performance.  The content included in these degrees may or may not have relevance to the skill sets   identified by regional industry as essential to their needs.  In addition, Ohio State, like many universities,   has hiring tracks  for clinical and practitioner faculty, whose role is to provide a more industry -oriented  perspective in coursework and internship creation.  These efforts do address some needs.     But there is much more that the university could be doing to meet the workf orce education needs  of the region and the state.   A few professional programs at Ohio State have begun to create external   advisory boards consisting of industry stakeholders.  These boards can provide advice to the university on   the curricular elements t hey deem most critical in graduates of these programs.  In this way, industry  
p1203
aVThe Ohio State University  APLU Innovation and Economic Prosperity Award  August 19, 2013   14  stakeholders are fully engaged in the effort.  This practice should be extended to other professional  master\u2122s programs, as well as to the curricula of undergraduate programs.  I n addition, more programs  that address the needs of in -career employees in the organizations of our most strategic industry partners  should be developed, and should contain the flexibility in scheduling that is necessary for these programs   to be successful .  In attempting to achieve the balance between a broad education and the inculcation of  specific job -related skills in these programs, a robust dialog with industry stakeholders is essential.  One model program at Ohio State is that created in collaboratio n with Honda, which addresses  the second need described above, that of providing professional development to in -career employees.  The  Advanced Degree Program (ADP) was developed in 2011 to provide Honda R&D associates the  opportunity to earn a master\u2122s de gree at Ohio State while continuing full -time employment at Honda.  ADP participants relocate to the Ohio State campus for a term of 16 months (working out of the MIX lab)  and work full -time on a combination of coursework and pre -negotiated research activit y. This enables the  associate to return to Honda as a technical expert in a particular field of study.  A second effort with IBM  focuses on preparing the future workforce in data analytics.  This program, currently under development,  is aimed more at preparing the future workforce that IBM and other companies will need in the data  analytics space.   This prog ram has been shaped in close partnership with a variety of industry partners in  addition to IBM and has provided input on curricular development from the program planning stage.     Importantly, it has already engaged cross -campus with such colleges as Busin ess, Engineering, Arts &  Sciences, and Health Sciences, with other colleges (e.g. Forestry, Agriculture and Environment Sciences)  eager to join the next phase of program development.  The aim of the program is to provide a cross  disciplinary data analytics  curriculum to students in any of the colleges mentioned above.  Furthermore,  the aim of the program is not \ufb01executive education\ufb02 for particular companies (e.g. for current IBM   employees, for example); instead the aim is the engagement of students in analy tics education across a  variety of fields well before they become employees.
p1204
aVThe Ohio State University  APLU Innovation and Economic Prosperity Award  August 19, 2013   15  Programs of this sort, developed in collaboration with strategic industry partners, can help to  create a more broadly -skilled workforce and enhance the productivity of the  company, thus creating a  positive impact on the regional economy.  Such programs can also serve as an industry attractant and  bring new jobs to the region.  This initiative should be expanded, and programs of this sort should be  explored with other selecte d strategic partners.  AREAS FOR IMPROVEME NT: COMMERCIALIZING UNIVERSITY  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY   As one of the largest and most diverse universities in the country, Ohio State has the opportunity  to become a major driver of economic impact and breakthrough i nnovation.  Ohio State began a major  effort toward this goal by creating the Industry Liaison Office (ILO) in 2008 to foster economic   development opportunities with its business partners.  Housed in the Office of Research, the ILO  encourages innovation by s erving as the \ufb01gateway\ufb02 for industry partners interested in tapping into Ohio  State expertise to help develop new products and increase efficiencies.  Ohio State currently ranks third in  industry -sponsored research, due largely to the efforts of the ILO.
p1205
aVIn addition to the ILO, the university launched  a new office of Technology Commercialization  and Knowledge Transfer (TCO)  in 2010  with the goal of building a new model that efficiently translates  research into new products, new industries, and global im pact. One of the top priorities for TCO is to  increase industry -sponsored research and long -term partnerships as well as creat e a robust start -up culture  that drives  regional  economic development.  In fact, the template for the creation of this new office w as called for in the regional Columbus 2020 economic development plan conceived over four years ago. T he  major objectives of this long -term initiative are to create  the following in the Columbus region as well as  on the Ohio State campus : a culture of inno vation, a long -term sustainable str ucture, customized  initiatives and  high value startups. TCO\u2122s objectives also include the call to   create large -scale  university -industry  partnerships,  engage  one of the largest  student & alumni  networks in the world , an d measure  success  on campus and as part of a regional public -private plan . 
p1206
aVThe Ohio State University  APLU Innovation and Economic Prosperity Award  August 19, 2013   16  Some of the triggers of this new initiative were based on where the university ranked in 2011  with regards to commercialization of the university\u2122s  intellectual property :   29th in u niversity startups (6)   15th in research expenditures ($823m)   73rd in licensing revenue ($1.4m)   For a university  with  internationally r ecognized research programs,  ranked third among all U.S.  universities in industry -sponsored research, these rankings in s tartups, expenditures, and licensing  were  simply not as  high as expected . This has called for the changes mentioned above in the creation of TCO,  so that  Ohio State  can develop new methods and strategies to increase  its presence in the marketplace.  As an e xample of the   goal of making The Ohio State University an internationally recognized  leader in commercialization, TCO joined forces with the regional business incubator/accelerator,   TechColumbus, and formed a new program called The Innovation Gateway. The objective of t he program  is to increase the deal flow and new startups generated from the research enterprise.   The Innovation Gateway vision was made possible by state -funded award that is designed to aid  university -based  innovators and entrepreneurs  looking to advance  their vision through first -in-class  commercialization services in areas such as: idea assessment, business model generation, nailing the   customer need prior to starting a company, prototyping, project management, and business scaling ; all  these services  will be available through the program. New funds should be available in the third quarter of  2013. The catalyst fund could be as much as $8 million to be invested through fiscal year 2017.  Going forward, Ohio State\u2122s TCO has large goals and even bigger visi ons.  With plans in place to  create a $60 million Neuro -Commercialization Center; create an Industry Research Paradigm shift of $1 -2 million; franchise the ever -popular community/research/entrepreneur connect event Wakeup Startup; the  kick - off of gap -fund ing resources like the Innovation Fund and ACT Grants through TCO; even more  groundbreaking research commercialized into products with potential global societal impacts in  Ohio.   But  such large efforts  start small, and  include  build ing  a platform that will  allow our startups and  
p1207
aVThe Ohio State University  APLU Innovation and Economic Prosperity Award  August 19, 2013   17  licensing to grow and mature. We are constantly looking for new ideas, new inventions, new  entrepreneurs; all in order to create a stronger innovation -minded community on our campus to improve  the number of startups, increase our re search expenditures, and increase our licensing revenue.  AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:  ALUMNI   The Ohio State University has well over 400,000 living alumni, a major percentage of whom live  and work in Ohio.  These alumni make important contributions to the stat e\u2122s economy in every Ohio  county.  They are heads of corporations, leaders of nonprofits, engineers, scientists, teachers, agricultural  producers, and medical care specialists.  Individually, Ohio State alumni represent a powerful force in  Ohio\u2122s economy.   The university could make a strong statement about economic engagement in Ohio by   simply cataloguing the accomplishments of its alumni across the state.  However, the larger potential  impact of the university\u2122s alumni on the regional and state economy has  barely been tapped.    Most universities maintain an aggressively -updated roster of their alumni, and reach out to them  on many occasions to allow the alumni to reconnect with the university, either through athletics or social  events.  At  many  universities , including Ohio State, alumni are recruited to  interactwith students and  faculty  via  traditional methods  \u0152 guest lecturing, mentoring, recruiting, etc\u2013.   Obviously, t he longer -term  goal is to solicit donations from alumni for the university\u2122s development  efforts.  But the potential of the  alumni network extends far beyond these activities.  Leveraging the power of the alumni by connecting them more directly with current student  and  faculty venture s, forming them into networks for angel investment and entrep reneurial mentorship, and  bringing them together with university researchers and corporate partners in new  partnerships  can create  relationships and programs  that  magnify the combined impact of this group far beyond their individual  economic activities.   This concept of leveraging the strength of Ohio State\u2122s vast alumni network for  economic engagement partnerships is just now forming.   This is an area in which Ohio State can make a  significant contribution to the state\u2122s economy, and one which, to date, h as not been explored in any  systematic fashion by the university.

aVThe Ohio State University  APLU Innovation and Economic Prosperity Award  August 19, 2013   18  This  active partnership among Ohio State\u2122s Office of Research, Alumni Association, and  Technology Commercialization Office to create a more systematic approach for reaching out to alumni  across the state to engage them in networks for mentorship of current students and entrepreneurial faculty,  angel investment, and innovative industry -university economic partnerships would be a valuable first step  in realizing the broader potential for econ omic impact of this large and accomplished group of graduates.    Working in tandem with the university and regional business leaders, such networks could catalyze new   business development and create jobs in the region.  An initial  example  project in this dir ection is the TCNetwork (TCN), aimed at creating an  exclusive network of The Ohio State University\u2122s alumni entrepreneurs. Ohio State\u2122s Technology  Commercialization Office has begun to tap into Ohio State\u2122s alumni network to procure Business Leads  and CEOs  for Ohio State\u2122s growing list of startups, as well as to find participants for other programs,  events, and mentorship opportunities in the Technology Commercialization Office.   Alumni in the TCN  will also have the opportunity to help  vet the university\u2122s  early stage technologies and provide feedback  on the commercial viability of the intellectual property.   Mentoring faculty and students through the  commercialization and startup process, and creating new entrepreneurial programs are future areas of  involv ement for the TCNetwork.  Expansion of these efforts should create a robust alumni presence to  enhance the university\u2122s engagement in the economic future of the region.  This is an area in which Ohio  State can be doing much more, and thus one selected for  particular attention in the future.

aV  M AY  1,   2015   P ROCESS  N ARRATIVE   (W ORD  C OUNT :   2458/2500)   Introduction   Established in 1804 as   the first institution of higher learning in the Northwest Territory,  Ohio University has  earned  a distinguished  reputation for  academic excellence while fulfilling  our   mission of educational access and service to   32 Appalachian counties   in  southeastern , e ast central,  and southern   Ohio   through our main campus in Athens, Ohio and regional campus system. A critical  part of service   is  our long - standing history of  economic  development  and community engagement .     Ohio University is dedicated to continued  success   in  driving   regional  economic prosperity .  We  are  engaged in an intensive,  iterative  planning process that, after more than a year of  stakeholder dialogue and self - study,  is evolving into  a comprehensive Innovation Strategy t hat will  help guide future  inves tment   as we adapt  to meet the challenges of our third century.    Process Experience     The University initiated its planning process during the 2013  2014 academic year with a  leadership team  that includes   academic deans ,  the Provost,  Vice P resident for Finance and  Administration, Vice President for Research and Creative Activity, and  key   senior administrators.  I nitial  focus was  on  identifying academic and programmatic opportunities for s trategic investment  that would benefit our university c ommunity   and stimulate economic development in the region.   While our initial discussions predate    - assessment  resources,   c o nsultants Eva Klein & Associates   encouraged our foray into   a   broader   innovation - str ategy planning process    includ ing   inclusive  definition s    innovation

T he  l eadership  t eam  benchmarked definitions of  innovation in business, economic  development, and higher education.  The leadership team expanded it s operational definition of  innovation by identifying the  five   Realms of Innovation  broad areas or modes of endeavor in  which the University   has current  strengths and the potential to incubate   innovative thinking to  achieve  dramatic discoveries   or   pragmati c solutions .
p1217
aV  Page  3   of  30     This broad conceptualization of innovation, which is consistent with that of CICEP, presents  several advantages to the narrower historic focus on business and technology. It  invites  potentially  all academic disciplines of the University   to the table  while   e ncouraging   the leadership and faculty  to consider additional connections between research and service activities and the core  vision   of   . 2   The broader  defi nition also responds comprehensively to  increasing  economic - engagement mandates  of  the  Ohio state legislature and  the Ohio Board of Regents   to promote educational access, attainment, and  job readiness . Furthermore, it articulates a new, comprehensive model   that may be in the vanguard  o f   high er - education trends nationwide.    As part of its developing innovation strategy , the l eadership  t eam  proposed  four broad  portfolios of innovation and specific niche areas within those portfolios as candidates for special  university - level investment.  The structure is depicted below:

High - quality research,  scholarship, and creative activity in our existing disciplines remain a priority and may become the  focus of new investments as a result of college - level  strategic planning.   Promotion and Communication   As one of the few four - year universities in  our predominantly rural, Appalachian region   and  one of its largest employers , Ohio University  is  a highly visible participant in  the  economic - development dialogue .  P romotion and communication efforts occur within the context of such  dialogues, rather than simply through one - way information - dissemination campaigns. As described  previously, University representatives actively participate in ongoing  discussions with   ext ernal  stakeholders including regional and statewide economic - development groups  and   local  government officials.

S UMMARY OF  A CCOMPLISHMENT S   (W ORD  C OUNT :   1622/2000)   Over the past several decades, Ohio University has developed an extensive Innovation  Ecosystem.  The groundwork for this ecosystem was laid decade s ago, and the seeds of further  growth are currently being planted through new initiatives.  The components of  our current  ecosystem can be grouped into three broad areas of accomplishment: (1)  technology  commercialization ; (2)   support for small businesses;   an d (3)   talent development.  T his list   reflects  the early emphasis shared by most higher - education institutions on innovation in the realm of  business, technology commercialization, and economic development . Following are brief  descriptions of accomplishme nts in each of these three areas.     Technology Commercialization   Ohio University has  a strong record of accomplishment in the area of technology  commercialization. As mentioned previously, Ohio University ranked first among Ohio higher - education institutions for research licensing revenue  in fiscal year 2011  and 4th in the nation for  return on investment in research. 4     To facilitate the commercialization of technologies developed through its research  activities, the University established a  Technology Transfer Office   in 1991.

The University has a str ong research base in biotechnology that led to the establishment  in  1984  of the  Edison Biotechnology Institute   (EBI) ,   one of  six original technology centers  funded  through the Ohio Department of Development's Thomas Edison Program   to promote   technology - bas ed economic development.     EBI is   university setting that includes technology development and commercialization as well as business  assistance as part of its mission.   The institute   focuses on resear ching  the molecular/genetic basis of  diseases that disproportionately affect the people of Appalachian Ohio and that also are major  worldwide challenges.   A growth - hormone antagonist technology developed by researchers at EBI  in 1987 and subsequently licens ed to a pharmaceutical industry has to date generated $73   million  in royalties to the University.   Ohio University also supports technology commercialization through its  TechGROWTH  Ohio   initiative, which provides support services and funding to technology s tartup companies in  22   Ohio counties. One of six regional Entrepreneurial Signature Programs in the state,  TechGROWTH Ohio is the only one hosted by a university.   A state -  Frontier Entrepreneurial Signature Program help TechGR OWTH Ohio provide staff and Executives  in Residence who validate opportunities and prepare companies for investment; growth funding in  the form of small competitive grants and pre - seed investments; a regional network of angel  investors; and access to ventu re - capital markets. TechGROWTH Ohio facilitated the inflow of over  $218 million into the region over its first seven years, with a leverage ratio of over $9 of follow - on  resources acquired for client companies for every $1 of state money invested.

aV  Page  13   of  30   In partn ership with Ohio State University, Ohio University is establishing an  Ohio  Innovation Fund   to provide venture capital for technology companies based in the state. The Fund  has secured $35   million and projects an eventual fund size of $70   million.  The hiri ng process for a  fund director is now underway and the program is anticipated to launch later in 2015.    Support for small businesses   Ohio University provides a diverse portfolio of services to small businesses in its service  area. These programs integrate  consistently with local and regional economic development entities,  city planners, Port Authorities and other regional entities, offering services unavailable elsewhere.  The entrepreneurial ecosystem provides entrepreneurs access to no - cost business servic es, pre - seed capital and affordable office and laboratory space. The University has become the regional  entrepreneurship hub linking industry, higher education, government, nonprofits, and community  leaders to spur innovation, entrepreneurship, and regiona l economic development.   For clients in the earliest stages of developing and implementing their business ideas, the  University - operated  Small Business Development Center   has since 1988 provided consulting  services including business - plan development and financial  counseling and planning  . This program  can assist businesses of any type within its  seven - county area. The economic impact of this program  has been significant:  in 2012 alone, the SBDC helped clients secure $22.6   million in loans and equity  investment. Between 2007 and 2012, the SBDC helped clients create 505 jobs and retain another  1,038 jobs, a considerable number for this rural, low - income Appalachian service a rea.    Nascent technology companies can access the state - of - the - art facilities of the  Innovation  Center  resources include a special - purpose 36,000 square - foot building wit h wet labs, a shared biotech  facility, and office space. The center also provides  coaching   and coordinate s   mentoring support for  faculty, student ,   and regional entrepreneurs . Businesses incubated by the Innovation Center in

The University also helps enterprises of various types learn how to compete for government  contracts via its  Procurement Technical Assistance Center .   The PTAC concept was developed in   agreements with state agencies to establish local technical - assistance centers. In 2002 Ohio  University adopted the local P TAC program, incorporating it into the business - services portfolio of  the Voinovich School and providing matching funds to help support it. The PTAC staff provides  marketing, training, seminars, direct counseling, bid - preparation and post - award assistance,   and an  electronic bid - matching service to businesses seeking to compete for procurement contracts from  all levels of government. The initial PTAC service area was 17 counties, but it was expanded in 2012  to 37   counties, and in 2014 the State of Ohio expan ded it even further, to 55   counties. The impact of  this program has been considerable: the PTAC fa cilitated $314,654,794 in federal purchasing from  2,414 small businesses in 2014 .    Talent development   As an institution of higher education, Ohio University e ngages in talent development in the   economic and civic vitality of their communities in a myriad of ways. Yet for the purposes of this  discussion, the descr  - development activities will be restricted to  those that pertain most directly to  meeting an express need   that fosters economic prosperity  through innovation .    In  2013   Ohio University launched the  Center for Entrepreneurshi p , a   partnership of Ohio     that b uilds  up on a longstanding relationship between  the  two . The C enter  for Entrepreneurship  seeks to

The Center currently offers an Entrepreneurship major and certificate; supports  five entrep reneurship clubs;  collaborates with TechGROWTH Ohio and the Innovation Center to  provide  co - curricular opportunities for students ; and conducts and disseminates research on  entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial learning, corporate venturing, entre preneurial  behavior ,   and opportunity recognition .    through co - curricular activities.   Since 2012 the Center has hosted an annual  Startup Weekend , a  54 - hour startup  business competitions that let entrepreneurs pitch an idea, develop partnerships,  and gain expert coaching and advice from seasoned professionals. In 2013, two dozen  participants  including current and former students of Ohio University and other regional  e ducational institutions  organized into six teams to develop new business products and  companies .   The Innovation Center collaborates with other University partners in organizing and  promoting the event, including the Center for Entrepreneurship (described a bove).   Ohio   University also encourages innovation beyond the realm of business and industry.  Since 2013, our Scripps College of Communication has conducted an annual  Scripps  Innovation  Challenge   in which interdisciplinary teams of students (both graduate a nd undergraduate)  compete to creatively address media industry challenges through technology, service or other  product solutions. Teams that reach the finalist round develop their ideas with business plans and  prototypes and present them to media industry  professionals, financial experts and others during  Pitch Day.

Yet the self - study process outlined earlier in this  narrative has also revealed several opportunities for improvem ent.  Although we are initiating a  wide array of action projects,  w e have targeted the following three  initiatives   for particular  emphasis in our Growth and Improvement Plan.   1.   Expand our innovation agenda   Consistent with our broad definition of innovation, t  should expand to the other realms of innovation identified in our Innovation Strategy report. Thus a   mechanisms for delivery of innova tion content that includes integrated education and research  programs, services, specialized facilities, and pathways/organization/processes for outreach,  service provision, and mutually beneficial relationships with businesses, communities, state  agencies    In the long term, w e  recognize the need to  integrate  this  expanded understanding of  innovation into our institutional culture . This process has begun through the internal di scussions  involved in developing the Innovation Strategy (for which the final report is in development.) In  order to demonstrate our commitment in a more concrete way and to incentivize expanded  partnerships, we are launching a   new, internal Innovation Str ategy Fund.   This fund will  provide   funding  on a competitive basis  to support interdisciplinary/multi - planning unit team projects.    
p1256
aV  Page  21   of  30   These projects must advance innovation in areas drawn from an identified set of focused niches.  Activities that  may   be suppo rted by an   Ohio University Innovation Strategy    grant  will  include  research, scholarship, creative activity, instruction,  or   institutional operations.   Awards will be structured to support innovative projects and teams in various stages of  development.  Pro jects that meet a high standard for significance and probability of successful  execution will have access to major  one - time  awards that may be $1   million or more.   In recognition  that such interdisciplinary partnerships and ways of thinking take time to de velop, however,  smaller grants will also be available for planning and seed activities  (up to $20,000 and $50,000 ,  respectively ).    A Request for Proposal (RFP) process   was created by the leadership t eam and vetted  with faculty.  The program has been launc hed with a series of open meeting for interested parties,  networking meetings for parties seeking collaborators, and Q&A sessions. First round proposals  (one - page concept proposals) are due in mid May and w e plan to award our first round of  Innovation  Strategy Fund grants during the 2015  16 academic year.   The structure of this  program   is intended to incentivize collaborations that are  interdisciplinary and that  bridge   college/planning unit boundaries.  This goal reflects the fact that  pressing social problems  often benefit from interdisciplinary approaches.  This program should not  be interpreted as a devaluation of traditional disciplinary work, but rather an effort to leverage the   derdeveloped mode of collaborative  engagement.
p1257
aV2.   Facilitate and maximize partnerships    existing partnerships with external entities benefit the institution across a broa d range of activity,  but there is tremendous opportunity to increase the value of such relationships through a more  focused and coordinated approach.   Many academic units, administrative functions, and innovation  
p1258
aV  Page  22   of  30   ecosystem programs actively seek and partici pate in relationships with external entities, and the   will  encourages development of even more partnerships .  To build  upon  this interest and  coordinate and leverage these activities for more opportunities , the  U niversity ha s now committed to developing an Industry Partnership Office (IPO)   within the Office  of the Vice President for Research and Creative Activity.     In the past, most university/industry relationships have generally focused around a single  activity, such as spo nsored research, internship opportunities, job placement, philanthropy, or     for  cultivating mutually  beneficial partnerships and growing them across the full span of meaningful activity.  Th is new  IPO  will have major elements that are both outward - facing and inward - facing.  The outward - facing  component will require a strong ability to speak the language of the private sector and understand   - facing compon ent will require significant culture change at  the university, in terms of communication and a willingness to hand off relationships between  different offices, rather than claiming sole ownership.   A key element of the IPO will thus be staff  with signific ant experience in the private sector, and also the ability to foster connections within  the academic environment.  The IPO will also support a knowledge base with customer relationship  management technology and protocols for internal sharing and exchange o f information.   Initially  th e IPO will focus on the health and  wellness   sector, building  upon    these fields and new extension campuses with a health emphasis in central Ohio and Cleveland.   Over time the expectation is that t he IPO will become a comprehensive asset for growth of  partnerships with the potential to connect with all parts of the university.   A valuable  but often - overlooked  resource in building upon external partnerships is the   d throughout the world.   Many of these alumni, as well as   presence and/or mentoring students through meaningful engagement. Many of these members of  
p1259
aV  Page  23   of  30   the OHIO fami ly have highly advanced regional and technical expertise and would be an excellent  resource.   Ohio University will seek to leverage these relationships and expertise through a fledgling  enterprise called  The OHIO Group .     The concept of The OHIO Group is to  create a mentorship - based global consulting operation that  taps into   rovid es   quality services and  training for recent graduates through international professional opportunities.  The new entity will  s eek  to provide  high - impact consulting and capacity - building services to clients internationally ,   drawing on the expertise and network across all campuses   of Ohio University.  A more - active  presence in the domestic and international workplace presence  will   p lace  Ohio   University in a  position to build global and marketplace expertise and knowledge. It  will   also  create   an innovative  opportunity to offer new graduates as well as  current undergraduate and graduate  students with  real - world experiences through a mentorship - based workplace training program.    The OHIO Group will use an opportunistic entrepreneurial approach to conducting business  with a lean start - up, scaling the infrastructure in tangent with business growth. Initially,  The OHIO  Group, in collaboration with University leaders, will meet with key alumni, their networks, and  partner universities to identify potential projects and initiatives that could be pursued. These  projects will be collected and vetted against criteria   to determine University capacity. Once  established it will pursue all opportunities within its mandate and capacity.   3.   Remove barriers to innovation   The  Ohio Research Portal   initiative currently under development is one pathway to  reducing barriers to innov ation. The 2013 Ohio Board of Regents Condition Report identified such a  portal as a means to remediate the current lack of ready access to information on university  research expertise and technical facilities by companies and other external entities. As n oted  earlier, the   Condition Report was generated with substantial involvement by Ohio  
p1260
aV  Page  24   of  30   University personnel, and an Ohio University executive - on - loan to the Board of Regents is now  leading the planning and implementation of  the planned Ohio Researc h Portal . The portal will be  commissioned in late 2015 using pilot data from Case Western Reserve University, Ohio State  U niversity, and Ohio University;  later expansion  plans  include  bringing in additional  universities  throughout the state.   Even with Ohio    equip faculty and students with the knowledge and resources to turn specific potential innovations  into real opportunities. To address this continual barrier Ohio University  is  one   of six partner  institutions leading the development of an  Ohio I - Corps   program . M odeled on the National Science   - Corps program ,   this collaborative initiative is  designed  to equip   innovative faculty  and students to explore the  potential for r eal - world application s   of their research or technology.   Working closely with industry mentors and led by NSF - certified trainers with entrepreneurial  experience, faculty/student teams  will  complete intensive customer discovery, identify industry  needs, and  create solutions that are viable in the market.   Like its NSF counterpart, the Ohio I - Corps  will have maximum effect in the early stages of transitioning technology to a real - world application,  fitting well after an invention disclosure or during the one - ye ar provisional patent period. Teams  will learn to find answers quickly to critical market questions and determine where the technology    ustomers, learn and utilize the business model canvas methodology  to assess commercial viability,  receiving  blunt and direct feedback from the teaching team and  peers.   -  as well,  for the valuable learning opportunities they provide.    Funding for the Ohio I - Corps has been approved by the governor, and the first cohort is  currently being recruited for the program, with a planned start date in summer 2015.

p1280
aV Process Narrative   (W ord count: 2256/2500)   Introduction     Penn State helped  create   the   Kellogg Commission on the Future of State and Land Grant  Universities  in 1996  which defined  institutional  engagement as the integration of   teaching,  rese arch, and extension activities for   more  collaborative and  productive   partnerships with  external  constituencies.    The Commission  stressed that the traditional  one - way  approach   in  which universities   tran sfer their expertise to  constituents   is outmoded, and should be replaced by  the engagement model of  collaborative   learning, resource  sharing ,   a nd reciprocity.     Penn State made a commitment to b e a fully engaged institution when   the concept  was conc eived by the Kellogg Commission   and has undertaken a host of initiatives  toward that   goal.   I n 2008 Penn State received t he  Elective Community Engagement Classification from the  Carnegie Foundation fo r the Advancement of Teaching.   The Innovation and Economic  Prosperity  (IEP) initiative   of the Association of Public and   Land Grant Universities (APLU)  affords  an opportunity to   asses s progress   and develop strategies fo r further advancement .
p1281
aVProcess Experience     The process to obtain designation as an APLU  IEP   University requires  a  comprehensive  assessment of  University   economic  engagement activities and development of   an improv ement  plan to address   weaknesses   and better leverage strengths .   The process was  jointly  led by the  Vice President for Research and the Vice President for Outreach .   Th e  three  key   process  steps  undertaken  to achieve this  project   are described  next .   Project   Steering Committee   
p1282
aV   A 14 - member   Steering C ommittee comprised of key internal and external stakeholders   was established at the outset of the project in February 2014  to  provide overall guidance to   the  assessment and planning effort .   A roster of steering committee members is included in the  appendix to this application.  As indicated, the Steering Committee  includes Penn State faculty  members, students, and administrators, state government officials, and local economic  development lead ers.  The Steering Committee met face - to - face periodically during the process.   In addition to providing overall process guidance, the Committee functioned as a focus group ,  made substantive contributions to the assessment of Penn State innovation and econ omic  development activities, and reviewed and approved of the designation application.
p1283
aV   suggested   development is a more generally understood term.  Further, it was agreed that examination of  Penn State economic development activities should  primarily  focus  on Pennsylvania.  It was also  suggested that the concept of innovation should include the impact of Penn State research on  knowledge and product development within existing companies   as well as start - up companies  commercializing University research .  These   suggestions are reflect ed  in   this application.   Penn State Survey on Economic Development     A n opinion survey  was developed  and administered  with assistance from the Penn State  Survey Research Center  aimed at  assessing   levels of knowledge  and  perceptions ab out  the  quality of Penn State innovation and economic development activities.  The survey instrument  was pre - tested  and reviewed  by the Project Steering Committee and was extensively revised  based on feedback from the Committee .  The survey instrument   is i ncluded in the appendix.     
p1284
aV   The survey was distributed electronically   between March 24 and April 21, 2013   to  28,600   stakeholders ,   16,317 of whom are  Penn State faculty and staff members, students, and  administrators, and  the   remainder of whom are   external  representatives of state and local  government, economic and workforce development organizations,  private industry,  and others.    A total of 1,898   completed   questionnaires were re turned for a response rate of  6.6   percent.    It  should be noted   that the vast ma jority of respondents (97.3%) were internal stakeholders.   Metrics - Based  Self - Assessment     An   internal self - assess ment   of Penn State economic development and technology transfer  programs  was performed which  engaged   key inte rnal  stakeholders from all appropri ate  administrative and academic units .  Key participating units included the Office of Technology  Management, the Office of Sponsored Programs, the Office of Research Protections, the Office  of Development and Alumni Relations, the   Office of Human Resource s,  the College of  Engineeri ng, and regional campuses, among others.  In  execut ing   this element of the project  the  team adhered as closely as possible to the APLU  Commission on Innovation, Competitiveness,  and Economic Prosperity ( CICEP )   New Metrics of Univ ersity Economic Contributions .   However, some modifications were made due to dif ficulty in obtaining certain  data and to  accommodate important Penn State   activities   that might otherwise not be addressed.   Economic Engagement Enterprise     Three broad c ategories of  the  economic engagement  enterprise   are : 1)   relationships with  industry ; 2)  developing the regional and national   workforce ;  and  3)  knowledge incu bation and  acceleration .  Each of these is discussed  next :   Relationships with Industry

aV   In  the  peri od July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013 (FY 13) , Penn State   received  1,339 grants,  contracts, and sub - agreements from private sector entities including industry consortia and trade  associations, excluding federal pass - through dollars.   These 1,339 grants, contrac ts, and sub - agreements were awarded by 842 unique private sector entities.   During the same period (FY13),  Penn State research   expenditures from private sector sources were $69,295,000,  also  excluding  federal pass - through funds.
p1286
aV T hese  funds  are shown on Table 1 broken down  by for - profit and non - profit sources a nd  by major academic discipline.    Table 1 shows that of  the $34,878,000 total  research expenditures  attributable to private for - profit industry sources   in FY 13 , more than half ($17,780 ,000) were in  physical science and engineering disciplines.   Life sciences disciplines, while substantial,  account for 29 percent ($10,278,000) of the total.  Also significant, business and management  account for nearly 10 percent ($3,412,000) of these res earch expenditures.
p1287
aV This data show   that Penn State research relationships with industry are an important     economic engagement activities ,   and that much of this work is  concentrated in the  physical science and engineering   discip lines.    Consistent with the levels of  industry sponsored  research expenditures in medical sciences, Penn State conducts relatively  few  clinical trials.    During FY13 170 interventional trials were conducted  in each   phase as follows:   Pilot     7   Phase I     26   Phase II    57   Phase III   67   Phase IV   1   N/A     12

aVThe Penn State Small Business Development Center (SBDC) provided planning,  management, and technical assistance to 484 firms in its two - county service area.     Developing the Regional and National Workforce     Penn State  is strongly  dedicated   to  p roviding  experiential education including research  experie nces for undergraduate students and the   development and delivery of entrepreneurship  education programs.  As one especially noteworthy indication of the effectiveness of these  approaches, Penn State   ranked f irst in  the 2010 Wall Street Journal   survey of  corporate recruiters  for  producing the  best - qualified graduates   overall.    During FY13, approximately 1,480   graduate  students and 1,2 00 undergraduate students received a wage for work related to an  extern ally  funded grant or contract.

Penn State has also developed  undergraduate and graduate  entrepreneurship education  courses and programs.   These include 39 for - credit cour se offerings across seven Penn State  colleges and three campuses.  These 39 courses support  f ive   minor and certificate  programs   at  both undergraduate and graduate levels.

In addition,   50 of the 174 L earning Factory  capstone design projects executed in FY13 were sponsored by individual entrepreneurs or start - up companies.     Opportunities for student entrepreneurs to start companies are provided through the  above courses and capstone experiences, competitions which include Idea Pitch in the College of  Business and AG Springboard in the College of Agricultural Sc iences, and student organizations  including Innoblue and Nittany Entrepreneurs.  Seven new companies were launched by P enn  State students during FY13.     Finally, Penn State alumni are a significant economic development asset.  More than  300,000 P enn State a lumni currently reside   in Pennsylva nia .   More than 6,800 Penn State alumni  hold President or other C - Level Executive positions in indust ry, 3,078 of which are located  in  Pennsylvania.   According to  a  2008 study conducted  for Penn State  by Tripp Umbach, more than  17,000 Penn State alumni own businesses in Pennsylvania  that   directly employ 475,000  residents.  The average wage at Pennsylvania based companies owned by Penn State graduates is  nearly $10,000 higher than the average wage in the   state.   Knowledge Incubation and Acceleration     Penn State operates  a business incubator facility in partnership with the Chamber of  Business and Industry   of Centre County , located at Innovation Park on the Penn State Campus .   Penn State also provides busin ess incubation services to prospective entrepreneurs  and existing  client companies  through the Ben Franklin Technology Partners of Central and   Northern  Pennsylvania, a state  sponsored  regional  economic development organization operated by the  University.

I n July 2011 Penn State hosted a national  conference entitled   The Legacy and the Promise: 150 Years of Land Grant   Universities  where  experts from   across the nation explored  approaches to fulfilling  the  engagement  model .   Penn   - accreditation by the Middle States Association of College s  and Schools , to be submitted in spring 2015,  has as its theme:  Living the Land - Grant Mission in  a Global Context .   This application  specifically ex plore s   challenges and opportunities  of  economic engagement .

aV Penn State  is currently preparing a new five - year strategic plan for the period beginning  July 1, 2015.  Four of the eleven supporting strategies for the plan directly relate to economic  develo pment:   1)  promoting technology   transfer and commercialization;   2)  support ing  innovation;   3)  encouraging   collaboration;   and  4)  simplifying business process es   to promote  agility in working with external partners.    These and other planning activities make cle ar Penn   at the national and worldwide levels, and will simultaneously do more to leverage its research  and education excellence for economic development in Penns ylvania.
p1297
aV   Promotion and Communication     Penn State has established a University Council on Engaged Scholarship to promote  engagement throughout the University.  Annually the Council in partnership with the Faculty  Senate makes two awards, the Faculty  Outreach Award and the Community   Engagement &  Scholarship Award . The Faculty Outreach Award recognizes a faculty member who has made a  significant contribution to outreach and has positively and substantively affected individuals,  organizations, or communi ties by extending their scholarship.  The Community Engagement and  Scholarship Award  is intended to recognize   an  outstanding engaged scholarship initiative   that  best exemplifies    dea of an engaged institution.
p1298
aVThe   Penn State Office of  Strategic Communications   along with public information  offices within most major academic and administrative units  communicate University education,  research, and service successes to internal and external constituencies including  Pen n State  faculty and staff, students, and  alumni ,  state and local government   officials , economic and  workforce development organizations,  private industry,  and  many  others.    The   many publications  produced by these organizations increasingly emphasize the ec onomic impacts of Penn State  programs.   As one illustration , the current issue of  Research Penn State , the flagship publication  of the Office of the Vice President for Research, highlights a dditive  manufacturing research and  its economic impacts.     Notwiths tanding these efforts, however, results   from  the  2014  Penn State Survey on  Economic Development  show a clear need for enhanced communication about economic  development   activities of the University, both internall y and externally.  On average, only 31%

aVo  engagement is the May 8 , 2014  announcement  of a  $500,000  NIST  Advanced Manufacturing  Technology Consortia ( AmTe ch)   award to Penn State  to establish an industry consortium for  additive manufacturing materials.  Major Penn State units participating in the effort include the  Applied  Research La boratory, the College of Earth and   Materials Science, the College of  Engineering, and Penn State Erie, The Behrend College.
p1301
aV   Penn State economic development policies and programs are routinely shared with other  institutions  in briefings, prese ntations and publications   in partnership with   organizations such as  APLU, AAU, the Industrial Research Institute (IRI),  the Association of University Technology  Managers (AUTM), the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE),  the University  Economic   Development Association (UEDA), the Pennsylvania Economic Development  Association (PEDA),  and many others.

aV Summary of Accomp lishments   (W ord count: 1983/2000)   Industry - University Research     Industry sponsored research is a core institutional strength of P enn State, especially in  science and engineering fields.   University stakeholders are aware of Penn State strengths in  industry - university research.   Nearly half (45.4 %) of respondents to the 2014 Penn State Survey  on Economic Development report that they   are fairly aware or very aware that Penn State  support s   existing Pennsylvania industry with technology development , which is the highest level  of awareness reported for any Penn State economic development activity with the exception of  career services.    F urther, these fairly or very aware respondents rate  the impact of  Penn State  support for existing Pennsylvania industry throug h technology development as good   (4.1 on a 1 - 5 scale).
p1303
aV This strength has developed over many years with significant university  investment in  industrial research program development and co - funding for indus try sponsored research projects   and has broadly contributed to industrial growth and development in Pennsylvania, the nation,  and the world.  More recently, as a result of Penn S  a number of steps have been taken or are planned  which are  aimed at further expanding industry - university research partnerships and focusing these activities toward Pennsylvania industry and  Pennsylvania economic d evelopment.     In 2012 Penn State   further established itself as a national leader in economic engagement   by dramatically modifying  terms for managing intellectual property (IP)   in industry sponsored  research contracts.   te will agree in advance to assign to  industry research sponsor s   any IP resulting from  their sponsored   project s at no cost other than  
p1304
aV patent costs , contingent upon concurrence of the Penn State investigators .   This new approach is  receiving  extremely   favor able attention from industry and is expected to result in  significantly  increased industry sponsor ed research  activity  at Penn State  in the years ahead.
p1305
aV A   key element in Penn State efforts to expand research p artnerships with Pennsylvania  industry is to   be a stronger regional economic development  partner   within the Commonwealth .    - 99 Innovation Corridor   initiative  which was established in 2005   to leverage the enhanced access provided to industry in three contiguous central  Pennsylvania  counties to   the Penn State University Park  research enterprise.   This partnership  focuses on  advanced materials research and technology transfer and  has   resulted in four   industry sponsored  research projec ts, six College of  Engineering L earning  F actory pro jects, and $6,000 ,000 of  leveraged  funding for industry - university research   to date .     A nother  example of expanded Penn State engagement in regional economic development  is  the Navy Yard in Philadelphia , one   of the largest and most dynami c urban redevelopment sites  in the nation.   Here,  Penn State efforts are focused on developing research and education  programs in clean energy and advanced manufacturing.  To date more than $140 million of state,  federal, and private funding has  been lever aged to support these Penn State  activities.

aV A third example is  Knowledg e Park in Erie, Pennsylvania,  a partnership of   Penn State  Erie, The Behrend College   and  DevelopErie established in 1999.   Knowledge Park houses   20   private  companies that employ more  than  500  workers .    Construction will begin this summer on  the new Advanced Manufacturing and Innovation  Center at Knowledge Park  where University  classrooms and laboratories will be co - located with industry partners.

aV M ost recently, Penn State has joined with Pennsylvania other six leading engineering  research universities to create the Pennsylvania Manufacturing Innovation Program.  These six  institutions are Drexel University, Carnegie Mellon University, Lehigh Univers ity, University of  Pennsylvania, University of Pittsburgh, and Temple University.  An Op Ed entitled  Made in  Pennsylvania:   A Model for America   co - authored by the seven university presidents calling for

aV increased leveraging of university strengths for manuf acturing revitalization   has appeared   in  every major newspaper in Pennsylvania .  T he  Pennsylvania  Manufacturing Innovation Program  is a unique partnership approach designed to connect university faculty members and students to  industry at an unprecedented s cale in Pennsylvania.   Hands - on Experiential Education     Hands - on experiential learning opportunities for students are at the core of the engaged  institution ideal.    In April 2014 Penn State submitted its application to the Carnegie Foundation  for the Advancement of Teaching to renew its Elective Community Engagement Classification.   This application sets a goal to provide   by 2020   at least one engaged experience for  every Penn  State student, making such engaged experiences a defining characte ristic of Penn State  education.     Respondents to the 2014 Penn State Survey on Economic Development report relatively  high levels of awareness about Penn State experiential educati on programs and high regard for  the quality of such programs.  Specifically, 41.8 percent of respondents are either fairly awa re or   very aware of these programs, and this group of respondents rates the q uality of these programs  as good   (score of 4.01 on a  1 - 5 scale).     U ndergraduate and graduate student   engagement   in both long -   and short - term  partnerships with industry can  simultaneously  enhance the educational   experience of our  studen ts and support economic development.  Long - term projects  typically involve   PhD students  for up to three years in discovery and development of new technologies and processes that meet  industry needs and the educational goals of the student.  Short - term projects address more  immediate industry challenges and involve Masters or und ergraduate students.   
p1311
aV   P enn State operates numerous programs to provide experiential learning opportunities for  Penn State students in partnership with industry.  Most notable is t he  College of Engineering  Learning Factory ,  which provides   engineering  senior s   with practical hands - on experience  through industry - sponsored capstone design projects.   The Learning Factory was established in  1995 with NSF support ,   and   1,630 projects have been completed to date involving more than  7500 students.   In 2006, the Learni ng Factory was awarded the National Academy of  Engineering's Gordon Prize for innovation in engineering educat ion.
p1312
aV Similar to the Learning Factory, the  Applied Professional Experience Prog ram in the  College of Business allows  MBA students  to  take on  real business projects for client firms  during their final semester.    At Penn State Erie,  all engineering students  complete hands - on  senior design project s, more than 80 percent of which are  industry sponsored.    A similar  hands - on senior design program is  in place  for engineering students at Penn State Berks, and the  Harrisburg Semester at Penn State Harrisburg provides summer internships to public policy  students from Penn State and other Pennsylvania institutions in the capital city.     These experiential l earning programs rely heavily on Penn State career services  and  employer relations  units to  establish and  maintain partnership with industry.  Annually more than  2,000 discreet employers participate in on - campus recruiting events and hundreds of these firm s  interface directly  and repeatedly  with  Penn State  students through student organizations,  sponsored research projects, and experiential learning programs.
p1313
aV Experiential education partnerships with communities also enhance education programs  and support   economic development.    For example:

aV   The Penn State Lew istown Center   provides  training  to  create a workforce  aligned   with  the workforce  investment    targeted   high priority jobs for the region .
p1318
aV     Finally, Penn State  provides hands - on learning opportunities that contribute to economic  development   in other parts of the  world , particularly in Africa.  Two  such   programs  are   the  Humanitarian Engineering and Social Entrepreneurship (HESE)   program   and  the  Parks and  People program.   The HESE program d evelop s   innovative and practical technology - based  solu tions to address the most compelling challenges facing the developing world and  marginalized communities. The Parks and People program integrates teaching, research and  service related to the management of protected areas, community social and economic  dev elopment, and public education in ecosystem services.   Entrepreneurship Training and Business Development     P enn State entrepreneurship training and business development programs have expanded   ent to economic engagement.    Penn State has established five minor and certificate programs supported by 39 courses.  These  programs are:

p1322
aV   Several of the courses supporting thes e programs encourage and assist students to  develop new products.  Through these courses, 51 student teams developed new product  concepts in FY13.   In addition to  these   for - credit  course s and  programs , robust non - credit  training opportunities in  entrepreneurship are also available at Penn State , a number o f which are  student - centered.  For example, t wo  annual  student competitions, IdeaPitch in the College of  Business an d AG Springboard in the College of Agricultural Science, each awarded cash priz es  of $1,000 to $3,000 to three winning student teams in FY13 to support commercialization  activities.
p1323
aV  Also in FY13, the Department of Mechanical and Nuclear Engineering held an  innovation competition and awarded $10,000 to four student teams, leading t o the creation of one  new student - led venture.    Two   Penn State entrepreneurship training centers, the Lion Launch Pad  in the Of fice of Undergraduate Education   and Sparkplug, a joint effort by the College of Arts  and Architecture, the College of Business, a nd the College of Engineering,  provided mentoring  services and $500 to   $1,000 awards to seven student - led ventures in FY13.  Innoblue , one of  
p1324
aV several student organizations dedicated to entrepreneurship, organized a  1,000 Pitches Summit   in  FY13 and awarded  $1,000 prizes to each of eight student winners.
p1325
aVIn addition to  these  student - centered activities   are the TechCelerators established  in  Carlisle, Hershey, and State College, Pennsylvania  by the Ben Franklin Technology Partners of  Central and Northern Penn sylvania, a state sponsored economic development organization of  Penn State.   T he TechCelerators offer entrepreneurs, students, faculty members, and small  business owners designated space, loan and investment programs, business support and  mentoring servic es, and entrepreneurial   training.   To date, 70   entrepreneurs and new businesses  have participated in TechCelerator  programs  including   55   Penn Sta te faculty members and  students.  To date, 18 companies have been launched from these efforts to  commercialize  Penn  State discoveries.     T he Penn State Research Foundation (PSRF) was established in  1992 to support  patenting and licensing of Penn State technologies.  PSRF is managed by a 15 - member Board of  Directors comprised of entrepreneurs, business managers, and  investors.  PSRF invests a portion  of royalties earned from licensed technologies in commercialization programs and start - up  companies.   PSRF   has licensed  more than 365 technologies to industry ,  including 93   start - up  companies .  Most recently PSRF and the  University have partnered to create the   new   $1 million   Penn State Fund for Innovation to support proof - of - concept research aimed at commercialization  of  Penn State   technologies.     Finally, the Innovation Transfer Network at Penn State Harrisburg was established in  2006 to connect regional industry to faculty members and students at 15 primarily undergraduate  institutions serving south central Pennsylvania, and stimulate  collaborativ e  applied research and  technology co mmercializat ion.    To date the Innovation Transfer Network has leveraged $9

aV While Penn State ent repreneurship training and business development programs have  expanded significantly in recent years, respondents to the 2014 Penn State Survey on Economic  Development report only modest awareness of the se activities.  Specifically, more than half of  respo ndents  (52%)  consider themselves  unaware   or  only a little   aware of Penn State efforts to  support th e growth of spin - out companies.

aV Improvement Plan   (W ord count: 1767/2000)   A s described in the previous sections of this application,  Penn State  has undertaken a  host of initiatives   aimed at improving its economic engagement performance   in recent years .   While   these achievements   are impressive , weaknesses can be identified and improvement s   can  be ma de.  Presented b elow are three  goals and related objectives  and activities  for improving  Penn State economic devel opment  performance :   Improvement Goal 1: Leverage  Industry Relations   for Economic Development     Industry   relations are crucial for industry sponsored research, hands - on educational  experiences, and other economic development activities.  Industry sponsored research is  a core  strength of Penn State especially in science and  engineering fields , and industry participation is  strong in hands - on education programs like the Learning Factory .  Steps can be taken to better  leverage this strength for Pennsylvania economic development.   Objective : Leverage career service s and employer  relations units
p1330
aV  Evidence suggests that  Penn State career services and employer relations  activities   are a   resource  that can be   leveraged   to improve economic development performance .   Respondents to  the 2014 Penn State Survey on Economic Development repo rt relatively high levels of awareness  about Penn State career services  and employer relations programs   and high regard for the quality  of these activities.  Nearly one - half of respondents (48.5%) indicate that they are fairly aware or  very aware of Penn S tate efforts to promote career opportunities for students in Pennsylvania,  and these same respondents rate the quality of these efforts the highest of any Penn State  economic development activity included in the survey   (score of 4.19 on a 1 - 5 scale).   
p1331
aV   Rec ruitment of students by prospective employers is a primary motivation for industry  participation in experiential learning programs at Penn State.  The Penn State units most heavily  involved in career services and employer relations activities are the   College of Business,  the  College of  Earth and Mineral Sciences,  the College of Engineering, and the College of  Information Sciences and Technologies .
p1332
aV Given the high levels of awareness about Penn State  career services and employer  relations activities  and the high regard for the quality of these programs, strategies should be  explored to leverage the industry existing connections of these programs to expand industry  sponsored resear ch and industry participation i n experiential education programs, with a   focus on  Pennsylvania industry and Pennsylvania economic devel opment.  Actions could include:
p1333
aVCreate opportunities to acquaint   Pennsylvania industry recruiters with  Penn State  research  programs during visits to Penn State .
p1334
aVCreate opportunities to acquaint   Pennsylvania industry recruiters with Penn  State  experiential learning programs during visits to Penn State .
p1335
aVInvite state and local economic  and workforce  development officials to participate in  career services and employer relations events at Penn State .     Objective : Leverage faculty performers   of industry sponsored research     Industry relationships maintained by   faculty performers of industry sponsored research  programs may be another key resource to be leveraged   for Pennsylvania economic development .   Man y of these private sector entities include many global industrial giants ,  small and medium  size manufacturers , and new technology start - ups.   Of the  842 unique private sector entities that  awarded  grants , contracts, and sub - agreements to Penn State in FY13, 220 (26%) are  
p1336
aV Pennsylvania based.  Strategies should be explored to expand participation by Pennsylvania  firms in industry - university technology partnerships .
p1337
aV    It has been noted that Penn State rese arch expenditures from for - profit industry sources  were $34,878,000 in FY 13.  It should also be noted that nearly one - half of th is  industry - sponsored research  funding   can be attributed to less than 50 faculty investigators.  These faculty  performers of ma jor industry sponsored research programs  possess strong relationships with  industry sponsors that can support economic development efforts.    Actions could include:
p1338
aVConvene periodic meetings of faculty performers of industry sponsored research to  identify  a pproaches to   strengthen   and  expand   industry - university research partnerships .
p1339
aVOrganize periodic briefings on research programs and tours of facilities for state and local  economic development officials and their industry clients .
p1340
aVWork with state and local  economic development leaders   to  engage  more   Pennsylvania  firms   in  industry - university  technology partnerships  at Penn State .     Improvement Goal 2:  Communicat e Penn State Economic Development Successes     When asked about their level of awareness about Penn  State efforts to communicate its  economic development successes, 56.7 percent of respondents report that they are unaware or  only a little aware of such efforts.  Those who are fairly aware or very aware of Penn State  efforts to communicate its economic de velopment successes (17.1 percent of respondents) rate  the quality of those efforts at 3.78 on a 1 - 5 scale, slightly above a moderate level of quality.   Steps can be taken to improve communications about Penn State economic development  successes .
p1341
aV Objecti ve :  Increase internal awareness of economic development successes     Penn State has recently restructured its   Office of Strategic Communications   and a new  Vice President for Strategic Communications is now being recruited to lead this critical activity.   Key   units within the Office of Strategic Communications are the   Department of News and Media  Relations  which  works to position Penn State as a leader in the integration of teaching, research  and public service and  to  enhance the University's reputation , and t he   Department of Research  Communications  which   s premier  research universities.  A new electronic publication,  Penn State Today , is now being inaugurated  and will be distributed daily to 130,000 P enn State faculty members, staff, and students.   Actions  to improve  communications about Penn State economic devel opment successes could include:
p1342
aVConvene regular meetings of  representatives from Penn State economic development and  communications units to e xplore opportunities for communication about successes .
p1343
aVChallenge  Penn State  research and technology transfer program managers to identify  successes for use by   communications units on a regular basis .
p1344
aVEnsure that Penn State economic development successes are routinely reported in the  newly inaugurated electronic daily publication,  Penn State Today.     Objective:  Target  information about successes  to key   external stakeholders     The 2014 Penn State survey on   Economic Development was distributed to 28,600   individuals,   more than 12,000 of whom are external stakeholders representing state and local  government, private industry,  economic and workforce development organizations , and others.   Of these only 83 quest ionnaires were returned representing just 2.7 percent of t he responses.   
p1345
aV This suggests a   low level of  awareness  and interest  in Penn State economic development  activities among key external stakeholders.
p1346
aVCommunications about Penn State economic developme nt successes should target  internal audiences  including faculty members, stude nts, staff, and administrators.  At the same  time, it would appear to be very important for such communications to target key external  stakeholder groups such as representatives  of state and local government, private industry, and  economic and workforce development organizations .   Actions to improve  communications about  Penn State economic development successes to exter nal stakeholders could include:
p1347
aVDisseminate information about  Penn State economic development successes to state and  local government, industry, and  economic and workforce development   officials .
p1348
aVEnsure   active  Penn State participation in state and local economic development program  planning and  implementation  a ctivities .
p1349
aVPeriodically  survey external constituencies to mea sure levels of awareness about P enn  State economic development successes .     Improvement Goal 3:  Raise Awareness of  Economic Development  as  a Priority     As described in the previous sections of thi s application, Penn State  has undertaken a host  of initiatives   aimed at improving its economic engagement performance in recent years.  Some  of these major accompl ishments are summarized below:
p1350
aV Continued national leader ship   in  industry sponsored research ,   with total industry  sponsored research expenditures in FY 2012 of $110 million   according to the NSF
p1351
aVContinued leadership in technology licensing to both new and existing industry, with  more than 365 technologies  licensed   to date,  including 65  to  start - up  companies.
p1352
aV    Creation of   major new hands - on learning experiences for undergraduate students in  partnership with industry, such as the College of Engineering Learning Factory
p1353
aVCreation of   new curriculum in entrepreneurship and innovation, including new  un dergraduate minors in entrepreneurship and mentoring  programs  for entrepreneurs
p1354
aVLaunching the I - 99 Corridor initiative in partnership with local leaders to leverage Penn  State materials research strengths for economic development in central Pennsylvania
p1355
aVContinued expansion of Knowledge Par k in Erie by Penn State Behrend and  DevelopErie ,  now  housing 20   firms   employing more than  500  workers .
p1356
aVDeveloping   a clean energy and manufacturing  research  campus at the Navy Yard in   gest and most dynamic urban redevelopment sites
p1357
aVRevamping intellectual property management policies governing industry sponsored  research to make Penn State research more accessible to our industry partners
p1358
aV   Despite the substantial economic development activities underway at Penn State, only 5.1  percent of respondents to the 2014 Penn State Survey on Economic Development are very aware  that Penn State emphasizes economic development as a priority.   Steps can b e taken to raise  Pennsylvania economic development as an institutional priority.   Objective:  Improve accessibility of University  economic development   resources     Only 28.1 percent of respondents to the 2014 Penn State survey on economic   development are fairl y aware or   very aware of Penn State efforts to maintain portals to provide  easy access to expertise and facilities.  These same respondents rate the impact of these efforts at  
p1359
aV 3.83 on a 1 - 5 scale, which is just above the midpoint between moderate and good.    This indicates  a need to improve web - based accessibility of Penn State resources.   Actions  for improving  access to Penn State   economic development resources  especially for Pennsylvania industry  include:
p1360
aV Establish a new position of  Associate Vice Preside nt   for Research for Industrial   Relations   with  responsibility for improved industry access to Penn State resources .
p1361
aVEnsure condu c ive terms for licensing of Penn State technologies  and participation in  University research programs by   Pennsylvania  industry.     Objective:  Develop initiatives for expanded  Pennsylvania economic development     Nearly three - fo urths of respondents to the 2014   Penn State survey on economic  development report that they  have little or no  aware ness   of   Penn State economic development  resourc es  that  are readily accessible   to external stakeholders .  The 10.5 percent of respondents  who are fairly aware or very aware that these resources are readily available rate the impact of  these services at 3.62 on a 1 - 5 scale, roughly midway between fair an d good.  These are the  lowest level s   of awareness and the lowest rating for any economic development activity  descr ibed on the survey instrument.     Initiative s   can be developed to increase the availability and the impacts   of  Penn State  economic development   resources .  Such initiative s   should engage all relevant Penn State units  and be developed in partnership with  state and local government, economic and workforce  development organizations,  private industry,  and others.    Activities to achieve this objective  include:   
p1362
aV    Continue  to develop the Pennsylvania Manufacturing Innovation Program as a  partnership of the Commonwealth and     seven  leading   research universities .
p1363
aVContinue to expand the Learning Factory and other experiential educational programs in  partnership   with   economic development organizations, private industry, and others .
p1364
aVContinue to develop manufacturing centers of excellence to assist industry within regions  of the Commonwealth to assist local industry with research and technology transfer .

Many Purdue engagement functions  have   advisory boards  comprised   of   regional development expert s  and business leaders.   S urvey  feedback   was gathered from   these  experts , as well as facu lty, administrators  and alumni.

aV    6     Despite these important achievements,  Purdue  continues  to  face many  opportunities   as  detailed in our  Growth Plan.  These  opportunities  include   working closely with industry to ensure  we matriculate students who have the relevant high - tech   problem - solving   skills needed by employers. Recognizing  the   computer scientists, we are  committed to  dramatically  expanding our College of Engineering and enhancing the size of  our Department of Computer Science.  In addition, with a   recent  $5 million grant fr om the Lilly Endowment , Purdue is positioned   to help expand the number of high - skilled jobs  in  Indiana by  attracting new  h igh - tech firms  a nd targeting the expansion of   -    --   enterprises that are too often  unrecognized   or under - appreci ated as economic assets that are already a part of the economic fabric of  communiti es and regions across the state .

The  OTC also  increased   commercial deals  by   8%  (reaching 85) and increased the   number   of issu ed patents by 8%  (reaching 103) .     .  Endocyte is a leader in developing targeted  small molecule drug conjugates (SMDCs) and companion imaging agents for personalized therapy in  cancer and other   serious diseases.   is the result of research conducted over the past 24  years ago by Philip S. Low, the Ralph C. Corley Distinguished Professor of Chemistry and director of the  Purdue Center for Drug Discovery, and Christopher P. Leamon, th en his graduate research assistant. Low  is chief sc ience officer at Endocyte Inc.  and Leamon is the vice president of research and development of  the company.   The Endocyte technology,    attaches a drug or imaging agent to a modified form of the vitam in  folic     to seek out and attach to cancer cells. Endocyte uses its proprietary  technology to create novel SMDCs and companion imaging agents for personalized targeted therapies.  The company's SMDCs actively target recepto rs that are expressed or over - expressed on diseased cells,  relative to healthy cells. This targeted approach is designed to enable the treatment of patients with  highly potent drugs into these cells. The companion imaging agents are designed to identify pa tients  whose disease expresses the molecular target of the therapy and who therefore may be more likely to  benefit from treatment.  7   Another example

One   example of this  engagement  is the composition  and role  of t he Trask Innovation Fund  (TIF)  board, which is  composed of business executives from both small and large enterprises, univer sity  faculty and administration, and PRF leadership   to guide investment decisions.   Th e TIF board   engages the  community at large and also gives an opportunity to those involved to shape and direct emergi ng  university technologies in  positive way s .  A direct result of this is  reflected in the external score for   - stage  innovat  /7 ).     A third factor in     actively educating faculty,  students, and com panies about   relevant topics.  One  example is a  lunch - time seminar series on technology commercialization topics  that   have engaged the Purdue ecosystem at large and resulted in  increased discussion and understanding around ideation, company formation, and the entire  commercialization process from idea g eneration to product sales by a company.

aV   II I . Growth/Improvement Plan   III.A  Growth Area 1:  Workforce Development   -   TALENT   Purdue is focused upon ensuring our students matriculate into a workforce with relevant, job - ready  skills.  C onsequently,  Purdue is   ad apting the size and scope of our   colleges   to meet industry needs. One  such example is  concern that   the U.S. is not producin g enough  highly skilled  engineers  for our industries  to remain   competitive.     20 years, the percentage of engineers graduating in the United States has stagnated, while India and China   , former  president and chief executive of Intel Corp.     Jobs and Competitiveness,   in a 2011 Wall Street Journal  column . 10   Consequently,   Purdue   Moves   has outlined the major objectives for   the next five years :   (i)  hiring  107 additional College of Engineering faculty members ;   (ii)  expanding our graduate student enrollment  by 750 ;   and  (iii) expanding  our undergraduate student enrollment by nearly 70 0.  These   objectives   will be  successful if we    ties and  have a positive impact on the  classroom by  lower ing   our undergrad - to - faculty ratio from 21.2 - to - 1 to 17 - to - 1 .   Purdue University is also adapting  the scope of o ur curriculum   to prepare more entrepreneurially  minded graduates.   T he College of Technology , which   has a significant  focus upon the  applications   of  engineering,   is transforming   into the  experiential - focuse d Purdue Polytechnic Institute.  Having a  new  vision, the
p1515
aVredesigned curriculum will teach students the science of demand - driven innovation  and entrepreneurship, and provide hands - on experiences including semester - long internships and  design - lab courses every year. All Polytechnic students   will also develop either a market - ready product or  business plan   prior to grad uation .    learning and  food security   resulting in (2)  dissertations   
p1516
aV    30     Employers have also expressed a growing need for a   workforce  with the   ability to collect, analyze and  disseminate vast amounts of data.  Purdue Moves   is  striving to  meet   this need   by increasing our number of  Computer Science  students  by 25 perce nt and crea ting  a   special program at Purdue in the area of Data  Science . A k    success   will be   if   Purdue becomes   a recognized leader in  collecting, anal yzing and disseminating data with ne w models for computer software.  Purdue also has  received funding from the Lilly Endowment to develop INcareer Express,  an open, interactive  visualization platform for career   mapping .  A career map visually links degree  programs to courses,  knowledge sets to   occupations, and industries to companies , all based on up - to - date information.   INcareer  Express will support the   interactions needed   to   enable   incoming Purdue students   to develop   meaningful  career maps   that tie specif ic education   programs to emerging job   opportunities.   Each of these objectives are recognized as top priorities throughout Purdue; hiring is already  underway in the College of Engineering, curriculum development in process for the Polytechnic Institute  and  a third year of the   tuition freeze is currently pending board approval . There have bee n many hurdles  as   funding limitations,  administrative challenges related to t he  transition to a trimester   academic  calendar,  and curriculum  changes (Purdue is still in th e process of shaping the  trimester   calendar and the  Polytechnic Institute).    All of these  objectives, from adapting the size and scope of our colleges to making educational opportuniti es  affordable,  combine together to  create the   adaptive framework  necessary to help meet    workforce  needs.     III.B   Growth Area 2 :  Messaging and Communication Infrastructure    -   CONNECTIONS   The APLU survey crystalized the need for improved messaging and communication in a broad range  of areas

aV    31     a very short time but there is still   a disconnect with the existing business community in the state. Purdue  needs a more aggressive direct business   outreach str    Purdue has recognized this need in recent years and has begun making improvements. One such  example is the development of the Collaboration Express, which is part of the $5 million grant to increase  high - tech jobs in Indiana funded by the Lilly Endowment.  A key role of the Collaboration Express is to   number of lost opportunities for collaboration due to a po or chain of communication.  If a potential  stakeholder contacts a Purdue employee with an economic engagement opportunity, but that Purdue  employee is not informed about that topic nor knows the best contact, the employee can simply provide  the potential s takeholder with the contact information for the Collaboration Express.  T he Collab oration  Express will forward the stakeholder   efficiently,  or help   begin building a robust and effective partnership  with Purdue.   To further strengthen our external stakeholder  developing two new outreach tools. The first  tool  is a new 160 - page website   with social - media - interactive  functions. It will also   featur e    - identify  and select how they want to engage with Purdue. The second   outreach tool   is a   -  be   contact information. This leave - behi nd will be provided to all key personnel who interact with the public,  in order to promote broad distribution.    must be addressed as a systemic improvement.  As of January 2013, representatives from the University  Development Office, Office of Vice President for Research and the Office of Engagement began meeting  monthly  to better address major institutional changes such as this  and   discuss collaborative fundin g  initiatives.    to have a positive impact upon cross - campus communication and collaboration.   One example   is   Bio - Olympiad,   a regional   event  hosted at Purdue  that inv olves more than 600  high school  students   vying for

Purdue is proud these companies  have achieved job growth during an economic recession, but also recognizes much greater potential job  growth is possible.    T he Collaboration Express ,  which is part of a  $5 million grant awarded in 2013 by the Lilly  Endowment, includes  implement ing

aVtarget goal is to help increase the profits of at  least 60 Indiana companies over five years, and increase the number of Second - Stage companies  participating in our Co - Op program to at least 100.   The Collaboration Express   will also  work with the PCRD to  implement an Economic Gardening  program, which is an alternative to traditi onal Economic D evelopment practices. Through this approach,  second  stage companies benefit from research and sophisticated information that is often only available  to large firms, s uch as core strategies and intelligence on markets, including database  and data mining  resources, search engine optimization, and geographic information systems 12   leading to informed   an d

aV  3   |  Page     APLU CICEP Designation Submission    South Dakota State University   Section 1: Process  Narrative.   (Word count: 2283/25 00)   1.1  Introduction   A   team of campus leaders met Dec. 13, 2013, to discuss the A ssociation of  P ublic  L and - Grant  U niversities    (APLU)  C ommission on  I nnovation,  C ompetitiveness, and  E conomic  P rosperity   Designation process and determined that South Dakota State University  (SDSU)  should engage in the evaluation process   and submit an application for d esignation with APLU.  The team, brought together by President David  L.  Chicoin e, included Kevin Kephart, vi ce  p re sident for research; Robert Otterson, executive assistant to the president; Michael Lockrem,  d i rector of University Marketing and   Communic ations; and William Aylor, d irector of  the  Technology Transfer   Office . Initial discussion  determined   how the phr   those definitions to gauge  the u niversit  encourage and facilitate innovation and economic  prosperity.   Innovation for  research institution s   can have many definitions i   but  was defined by the  team as new   thinking that creates value.   The   team   defined  economic prosperity  as   -  - being;  and  measured in some  way  such as   average income per household or per capita .  I mproved   prosperity i s being better - off  and   experiencing  enhanced well - being   in  terms of  standard of living and  quality of life.  In  economic development,  both of these are needed  to achieve prosperity.     These definitions are reflected in the process used by  the u niversity   and the key outcomes  that the  team  achieved .   The team was dedicated to thinking about the  assessment and  engagement process as a way to think differently about the role of  the u niversity   and find areas  where value could be created, captured, and strengthe ned in order to improve the  chance for  innovation and economic prosperity for   u niversity   employees, students, and stakeholders.

aV  4   |  Page     1.2  Process Experience   Initial team discussions revolved around the key  focus  areas for the team and how  it   could  best initiate a process that could produce acti onable results. The team    first  focus  area  was    wareness ,  allowing  the process to  engage  the   campus and determine the  level of awareness and co mmunication already present , give a voi ce to individuals on campus  who   wish to be involved in  the u niversity  in innov ation and economic prosperity, and  reach ou t to  the  u  entrepreneurial sectors through targeted education and involvement  in shaping   future goals.   A   second key area of focus ,    takeholders ,  was added  to  provide an opportunity for  non - u niversity   perspectives and experiences to determine how  the  u niversity   is  involved  in innovation and economic prosperity for the community,  allowing  external stakeholder s   more engagement   with  the u niversity , and help ing   shape future goals.   A ssessment  tools  provided by the APLU  were utilized  to gather data in key areas of  innovation and economic prosperity.  The surveys  were  uploaded to Questio nPro   without any  wording  changes  Jan.   16 ,   2014.  The surveys were sent to  internal and   external stakeholders from  the Office of the President with an   introductory message from the president for both e xternal ii   and i nternal iii   groups. The team  followed up with both groups on a  weekly basis to thank those  who   did participate, encourage others to   participate, and to update both groups on the upcoming  sc hedule of events ,   including the w orkshop.   The internal group responded with 32 completed  surveys iv   while the external group  responded   with 30 completed surveys v . T he team  also  scheduled working meeti ngs with both internal and external groups to gather data and narrative  points for the process and to capture success stories for educating both internal groups and  external stakeholders and for possible submission for other  recognition  programs .  External  stakeholders were encouraged to attend as many of the meetings as possible ,   including the APLU  Workshop.

aVmeeting market demand and thus delivering growth and development that has a  special dimension.   A workshop   brought   internal groups and external stakeholders together to discuss the role of  the u niversity  in innovation and economic prosperity and  to identify  areas of improvement  ide ntified by the survey  (Appendix I,II, and III) .  S takeholders  were asked to clarify   u niversity   roles   in   innovation and economic  prosperity,   discuss  accomplishments ,  reco rd relevant  dates and  facts, and  note  areas  for   improvement .  M e etings were largely attended by   external stakeholders   and en gaged internal groups, making   the  w orkshop  an eff ective venue for   participants  to discuss   the   u    role   and how it can   improve.   As the groups worked together in the meetings and the  w orkshop ,   it became clear the  u niversity   playe d a major role in innovation and e conomic prosperity and that  role  became  more   focused around 2007.  Between 2007 and 2008 ,   the u niversity   started the first Technology  Figure  1 : President David  L.  Chicoine makes a point  during discussions of a topic at   the APLU Workshop.

South Dakota Innovation  Partners vi   (SDIP)  started shortly thereafter.  The community of Brookings vii , brought a vision   creating high - paying,  science -   and  technology - driven jobs and h as partnered to give u niversity - based   st artups every chance to succeed.   In FY2013 ,   the u niversity   had t otal research ex penditure of mo r e   than  $6 3.8   million with  $5.9   million coming from priva te (nonpublic grant) sources.  The community of Brookings,  SDIP, and  the u niversity   are working together to leverage the research, relationships, and  innovation at  the u niversity   to create high - paying jobs, license technology, and create econ omic  prosperity in the region.  The  increased  industry engagement can be shown in the  recent number  of   agreements (non - disclosure , material tran s fer , license , c ollaboration , etc.) between  the  u niversity   and industry .   FY2003   yielded   five   agreements  while   FY2013  saw 203 executed  agreements.   The groups  discussed   different ways in which  the u niversity   can help innovate and  provide  economic prosperity ,   including   workforce development, research, consulting, and intellectual  property  development .     Regarding workforce development t he groups discussed how  the u niversity   is engaged in  creating new  degree - granting   programs based upon  workforce   needs . That i ndustry input into the  curriculum   develops futu r e leads regarding   industry and  u niversity   collaborations in research and  innovation.    Across campus ,   existing programs and new undergraduate and graduate degree  conferring programs are working with industry t o develop students ready for the job market .     New   doctoral programs in civil  and mechanical engineering and in agricultural and   biosystems  engineering  grew out of an ongoing relationship between the Jerome J. Lohr College  of Engineering and industry part ners.    the cities of  Sioux Falls, Omaha, Des Moines,  Minneapolis   and beyond, assuring graduates will

aV  7   |  Page     Along   those lines, the   a rchi tecture  studies  program began in 2009 based on   industry relations  and needs.  Four architecture firms provided startup funds   a nd advise  the program.  These firms  pushed for a  degree to   provide local talent   for  the design and building s ector since many of  the     li ce nsed architects  are  nearing retirement .  The   program  first  graduate s  walked in  spring 2014 commencement.  A new   A rchitecture, Math and En gineering building will open in  fall  2015 ,   providing the space needed for program   accreditation.  The  Division of Design is now  bringi ng together the design fields of  landscape, architecture, interior design, architecture ,   and  graphics design to better serve the industry.   Other programs have been created or changed   in response to industry needs.   An   o perations  management degree  has been added   to support  the  advanced manufa cturing sector and its  growth.  A new Ph . D .   program  in biochemistry, which was  developed in collaboration   with  Sanford Health/ Sanford  Research and t he Avera Health Research Institute ,  expand s   and bring s   focus to biochemistry workf orce development and for targeted   research in support of health care .  The non - university firms   contribute e ight industry researche r s to  s erve   as  adjunct faculty.   In 2008 ,   a  Ph . D .   program  was added  in  computational s ci ence and s tatistics . The financial  service sector has granted  fellowships  to  support   students  who will   provide  a nalytical support   and  become more analytically advanced  human capital for the sector.  The   u  partnership with Raven Industries  has created new m inors in precision agriculture and will start  in fall 2014. In addition, the Department of Agricultural and Biosystems   Engineering will launch  a precision ag riculture   strategic re investment wit h four   full - time employees   and  an  advanced  teaching lab  scheduled for 2016.   Industry relations have also benefitted from ,   and other times driven ,   relations hips   with other  institutions of higher learning   in the state .  The   Brookings - based   business Daktronics viii   has  agreed   to sponsor a faculty position in accounting to increase  the  accounting majors in the region  and  the state.  The u niversity has collaborated with Northern Stat e University on this position.  The university has  also started a  master  s  degree  with D akota State University  in the area of d ata   sciences and decision a nalytics , specializing  in  the  health care and financial services   sectors .   In  2013 ,   a partnership with Dacotah Bank was formed to a ccelerate and suppor t  collaborations with  Northern State Uni versity , primarily   in the agribusiness and  in the   banking a nd financial services   sectors  with the goal of graduating  more students with job - ready  skills.   The u niversity is teaming

This degree w ill be  an  online professional  degree for practicing professionals.   Also , e very department within the C ollege  of Agriculture and Biological Sciences  (ABS)  has  an industrial advisory board made up of  local and regional representatives . The boards meet  regularly with faculty and students to evaluate and define the attributes they will seek  from   future employees .  For example , food science  including food safety  has been   revitalizing and  refreshing  curricula to achieve certification by  the  Institute for Food Technology  in response   to  regional  growth in bio manufacturing .  This growth includes  milk product manufacturing ,   meat  proces sing, ethanol fermen tation, and  other manufacturing .     Additionally, the u niversity   offers a   wide range of internship opportunities   so   students   can   have confidence that graduates will arrive wit h both the preparation and real - world experience  that will allow them to excel.   University   researchers are  an invaluable member of  local economic prosperity through  c on sultation with local industry. Workshop a ttendees discussed how the  u niversity   can become  even more involved in this process and make  consultation easier and clearer for  u niversity   researchers.   Creating an   atmosphere conducive for  start up compa ny success has been one of the  u  .  T he u niversity has   partnered with SDIP to assist u niversity  employee - created companies and has worked  with both the Brookings community and SDIP  to help those com pan ies survive the valley of  death ,  continue to de - risk the technology ,   and make it more attractive to industry.  While   certain  areas of research  have   strong industry ties that make technology developed at  the u niversity   readily available for indus try licen se or for a start up to thrive ,   the u niversity , SDIP, and the  Figure  2 : A whiteboard discussion on the role of  SDSU in economic prosperity and innovation.

aV  9   |  Page     Brookings community have  heavily invested   in   making it possible for a start up to succeed  with  or  without established industry contacts.   However,  help must be given to  academic  departments  that do not have  effective  industry connections to   reach out to attract research collaboration,  innovation, and the sharing of ideas and  to  allow industry t o help shape research goals.   The u niversity   will continue to expand the capacity and abi lity to  reach out to  potential  industry partners  for collaboration .  The vice president for r e search is planning to  chang e   the  department  title  to the Division of Research and Economic Development   in order to gi ve  industry a clearer entry point   into  the u niversity .   Also, the  TTO   will continue to grow and work more on connections between industry and  areas of campus  without  strong  industrial ties. These goals are   not only in the u niversity    strategic plan ix ,  but also   specifically addressed in Section II.   1. 4  Promotion and Communication   One of the  workshop s  recommendation s was to continue  identify ing   possible   external  stakeholders and potential collaborative partners for  the numerous departments across  campus.   Engaged sectors of the  u niversity need   to determine additional stakeholders that are currently  under - r eco gnized and determine   their needs in both a re search and workforce capacity. As a  whole, t he u niversity  can do this  but each department may have a different set of stakeholders  and collabora tors that will need an individualize d plan.  The Division of Research and Economic  Development will work as a designated entity for outside groups to reach into the campus, but  strategies must  lead to greater engagement across the institution. Expanded enga gement will   build on the successes of SDSU Extension and Engineering Extension and work  of those entities  within th e state and local communities   1.5  Advancing University Economic Engagement Among Peers   The u niversity   was the first research institution  in  South   Dakota to establish   a Technology  Transfer Office. T he u niversity   has  since led   the  establishment of other  statewide  TTO offices  and  pushed for  best - in - class services through standard handling of intellectual property and  evaluation p rocesses  throughout.

aV  10   |  Page     Since inception ,   the  TTO   has grown from the first year of having five invention disclosures  in FY2008 to the following averages for FY2010 - FY2013:   Table 1: Relevant TTO Averages from FY2010 - FY2013   Invention  Disclosures   Patents Filed   Total Agree ments   Agreements  w/startups   Royalties per year   51   13   178   3   $1,820,324.00     Additionally, the u niversity  TTO works   with other  state institutions   that do not have a TTO  to provide service s .  The u niversity   has signed  memora n dums of understanding ( MOUs )   with  Dakota State University and Northern State University to help evaluate, protect, and  commercialize intellectual property de veloped at those institutions.   SDIP has continued to grow with  u niversity support.   SDIP currently  licenses  technology   from  other institutions  across the nation and formed strategic partnerships   worldwide .   SDIP is  able to provide  researchers   with the ability to become a c hie f s cientific  o fficer of a start up  company while letting  the u niversity   a nd SDIP provide coverage in  business a nd legal areas.  Further more , the engagement with the local community has provided these companies and others  with the facilities and capacity to take idea s and inventions past the bench top, over the valley of  death,  an d from proof of  concept through   pilot -   and commercial - scale plants.

aV  11   |  Page     Section  2 :  Summary of Accomplishments .   (Word count: 1565 /2000)   This s ection addresses three areas of achievement in innovation and economic prosperity that  have been ongoing efforts of  the   u niversity  and are representative of its impact   on  economic  prosperity .   2.1  Entrepreneurial Growth and D e - risking intellectual property   The encouragement of entrepreneurial activities has been a long - standing goal of  the  u niversity   and an actionable item at the u niversity x , xi   and an impact of  SDSU  Extension xii , xiii , xiv .   In addition to working with researchers, employees, and the community,  the u niversity   has been  dedicating time and resources to fostering these a ctivities for students as we ll.   The u niversity   offers seven different business competitions for students xv   with mo r e   than  $45,000 in funds  available ,   in addition to specialized courses and lectures . xvi   In 2014, it established   the   first  Student App Contest and  plans to open   the contest next year  to  all  South Dakota college  students .   Undergraduate students have ample opportunities for laboratory research xvii , which   can  lead to publications, awards, and building resumes and connections for graduate school.   These  efforts are recogn ized at Undergraduate Research Day xviii , in the Journal of Undergraduate  Research xix ,  the annual Student Poster Session at the state Capitol xx   and  the South Dakota  Board  of Regents student research day.     While  the u niversity   has been a leading force in the entrepreneurial   growth of   South Dakota ,   there has   also been a goal to de - risk intellectual prope rty developed at  the u niversity   for startups  and industry.  Since  the u niversity and SDIP formalized a partnership  in November ,  2009,   the  two have  license d   21  u niversity   technologies through 16 license a greements from 10 different  research labs.  Since 2011, t hese technologies have formed the base and   expansion of seven  different start up companies in  e ngineering,  a nimal  h ealth,  p harmaceuticals,  h uman  h ealth,  b io fuels,  an d  others across all disciplines.   These companies currently em ploy mo r e   than  35   full - time employee s , have 37 patents and pending patent applications, and more than 35 worldwide  strategic partnerships .  The researcher s involved have been able to fund their work through  SMALL Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer ( SBIR/STTR )   funding, venture funding, and other private contributions while collaborating with researchers  
p1580
aV  12   |  Page     and industry around the wo rld. Company growth and expansion have   occurred rapidly a s the  companies have raised more than   $26 million  in private equity. These start ups have more than  doubled the state average of SBIR proposal s per  year and have been awarded mo r e   than $1.3  million in  P has e I and II   funding since 2011. Public or private grants have added  approximately  $5 million  in that same timeframe.  Prairie AquaT ech , xxi   which  started as an invention disclosure  in 2011 , ha s  raised $2 million in private and public fu nding  and is on a $10 million capital  project   building a pilot plant with the help of the university, BEDC, and SD Soybean  Processors xxii .   Community partnerships have further provided funds, laboratories, and equipment for these  companies .  The Research Park  at S DSU xxiii   broke ground in 2007 as the  first research   park  in  South   Dakota.  Other facilities  for startups  include:  Brookings BioSpace , xxiv   two proof of concept  labs xxv ,  and  the  Technology   Center for Rural Enterprise xxvi .   The  university   has also been helping to  de - risk technologies by providing access to proof of  concept funding through the Small Business Administration xxvii   and from the Sun Grant  Initiative xxviii   (mo r e than   $100,00 0 ) .  Funding from these projects have supporte d or directly led  to five start up companies ba sed upon  university   technologies.  Future funds will continue to  leverage available funding for proof of concept and encourage collaborations between  researchers across disciplines.   2.2  Industry Collaboration   and Recruitment   The  university   has been focused on building relationships and collaborations w ith relevant  external partners. In 2007 - 09 ,   the  university   averaged  63  agreements per year with intell ectual  property ramifications.  These agreements ra nge from non - disclosure agreement s to l i censes   and  collaboration a greements.  Over the last two years ,   th ese agreements have grown to mo r e   than  20 0 executed per year.   The  university   encourages   de partments and researchers to  collaborate  with industry at  higher rates than ever before.  Sponsored res earch and s po nsored s ervices are one  way of measuring such partnerships and  the  university   has seen an increase in these agreements  from   three   in 2007 to more than 40 in 2013. Non federal  sponsored  funding increased   from  $7.5  million  in 2007 to  $30.6  million in   2013 , a three - fold increase over the period .     
p1581
aV  13   |  Page     Another aspect of industry involvement has been the active recruitment of partners  to   campus, the Research Park, or the Brookings community . In August 2013,  Raven Industries,  South Dakota State  U nive rsity   and the Research  Park  announced  a  partnership focused on  research and development coupled with student experiential learning. The collaboration among  the three entities will concentrate on precision agriculture and a ssociated workforce  development.  T his type of partnership   enhances   economic growth in the state a nd region by  building on the  university  products, services and jobs .   Raven  currently has six   student interns working in Brookings .   A  similar recruitment brought the engineering  firm EleMech, Inc. to Brookings xxix .   According to a recent study published by Colorado State University agriculture  economists,  South Dakota ranks first   as the most agribusiness - friendly state in the nation. The s tudy reviewed  and ranked states on everything from governmental regulations and services pertaining to  agriculture inputs and meats and livestock pr oducts, to funding of the  South Dakota Department  of  Agriculture and percentage of the population with degre es in agriculture, environment and  sciences.   In the case of Bel Brands   USA ,  these factors played a role in opening  its   newest  manufacturing  plant in  Brookings .  The company stated access to  local talent as well as research  and development were key in choosing to build in South Dakota.  The pl ant  will provide  approximately  275 South Dakotans with com petitive salaries and benefits   when fully staffed   and   producing 22 million pounds of its Mini Ba bybel cheese   each year .   Recruitment and collab oration is an ongoing process.  The  university   has continued to be  active in the process of getting industry to campus to visit with researchers. An example is the  2014 Livestock Biotech Summit xxx   to be held Septe mber in Sioux Falls.  The  university   has  partnered with the city of Brookings and SD B IO   to hold a pre conference tour xxxi   of SDSU and  the c ity . Individuals   will tour the Animal Resource Wing, Animal Disease Research and  Diagnostic La boratory, and Davis co   Dairy Plant at SDSU as well as drive through some other  units  including the Cow - Calf Teaching and Research Unit, Equine Teaching Facility, Ruminant  Nutrition Center, Sheep  Research  Unit, and Swine  Research  Unit and  Feed Mill .

aV 2.3  Best - in - Class Services from the TTO   The ongoing efforts to create an entrepreneurial culture, de - risk intellectual property created  at  the  university , recruit and collaborate with industry are supported by an increased awareness  from the TTO to be responsive to industry and p rovide best - in - c lass services.  The  university   has  long been a leader in innovation and economic prosperity in the state of South Dakota and that  leadership has been repeatedly shown in the protection and commercializa tion of intellectual  property.   University  leaders were  instrumental in re writing the  South Dakota  Board of Regents  Intellectual Property Policy xxxii , which   governs all intellectual property in  Regent al   institutions  in  South   Dakota.  The leadership has also led the TTO to provide best - in - class servic es which starts  with the TTO, vice president for r esearch, and Office of Research and Sponsored Programs  providing mo r e   than  20 educational seminars each year .  Over the last two years , the TTO has  created easy - to - negotiate standard agreements for industry coll aborations  including non - disclosure   (NDA) and material transfer (MTA) agreements , research collaboration, sponsored  r esearch , and sponsored s ervice. T he TTO has  also  placed these agreements and other  frequent ly  requested   documents, such as the Invention Disclosure Fo rm, on the TTO website for ease of use  for all parties xxxiii .   In order to encourage current partners to continue to work with  university   rese archers, the TTO has developed master agreements for facility use and s ponsored  s ervice for  selected partners  and a stan dard t est - only MTA for the ease of industrial partners that wish to test  university   plant varieties for potential f uture license or collaboration.   Over the last year ,   the TTO  has negotiated more master a greements than in the prior accumulated history of th e TTO  due to  the increased response by industry partners.  The TTO has also  formalized previous relationships  with Northern State University and Dakota State University to work together as a community in  the practice of technology transfer, derive mutual in sights on best practices, act in the best  interests of the public, and create an intellectual property and economic development  collaboration that is beneficial to all parties.   The TTO has also partnered with SDIP this yea r   to establish a joint group of m arketing   a nalysts.   These analysts are graduate students in scientific  disciplines .  They are jointly trained by  SDIP and the TTO on areas ranging from marketing reviews to  intellectual property reviews.  They then are given   in vention disclosures  from the TTO to analyze and provide   opinions on all

Additionally,  they work with the  university   start up companies  and  SDIP to perform background analysis a nd  groundwork   for communications with potential industry collaborators or partners.   In the first  year of the program ,   t hese analysts have evaluated mo r e   than  20 technologies, generated reports,  participated in   meetings with researchers and the TTO, and helped the TTO make informed  decisions on patentability, market potential, and finding connections within the marketplace for  university   innovation .

aV  18   |  Page     Section 3 :   Growth/Improvement Plan   (Word count: 1590 /2000)   The results of the assessment proces s, including the pre - works hop meetings and the  w orkshop ,   gave  opportunities for  university   improvement tha t have been implemented into a  growth/improvement p lan   that promote s the   raising  of  institutional awareness and e ngaging key  stakeholders.   3.1  Educational opportunities for faculty and students   A large gap  between importance and performance was in the educational opportunities  secti on of the internal assessment.  The   w orkshop provided an opportunity to determine  what  educational opportunities and programs  for  university   researchers and external stakeholders  w ould be of interest.   The combination of the asse ssment results and the workshop   allowed for  the stakeholders to paint the picture of areas in economic development and prosperity where  education would be helpful and work with all levels of administration within the  university   on  planning some fur ther educational opportunities .   M any ed ucational opportunities were mentioned f or  futu r e   implementation during the  w orkshop.  One educational opportunity was for researchers in terested in consultation and  potential  university   c onflict of interest  policies and procedures.   Th is education   would inc lude  workshops for re searchers and g raduate students to review   the policy   and   receive   advice and  information on h ow researchers can consult   within  South Dakota  Boar d of Regents policy  guidelines.   These procedures are currently  being refined   and the finalized version will provide an  opportunity to hold   a workshop so researchers can   learn about consul tation and the new  guidelines. Using   university   researchers  for consultation  is a valuable tool for industry and  external stakeholder  engagement.   A second area mentioned was for  education   on decision - making processes involved for filing  patents, how technologies are marketed   by the TTO , and what happens  to  the     to use the technology   after a license is signed . The TTO talks could b e   an opportunity for  interested parties to learn more about the process   and learn more about the TTO.  These talks  
p1591
aV  19   |  Page     could provide both an educational   opportunity and the ability for the TTO to  engage   researchers.  A measureable outcome would be increasing inn ovative disclosures to the TTO .   Another educational opportunity  discussed  at the w orkshop  was   e ducation   on entrepreneurial  activities beyond starting a business to  illustrate   the e n trepreneurial spirit on campus.   The  university   can build upon current efforts and initiatives to talk about other types of activities  that  encourage the entrepreneurial spirit.   M any  individuals on campus engage   in activities with an  entrepreneurial spirit  that may not nece ssarily be starting a company .  Education about the  entrepreneurial spirit is important for   those who   are no t in a start up, but are using  entrepreneurial  activities to work  with groups, large and small.   The TTO can also   become a part of the new graduate student w orkshop   held every August .   This would allow for the TTO to start a dialog with incoming graduate students  on invention,  intellectual property,  South Dakota  Board of Regents policy, and encourage innovation on the  university   campus by new students  who   will be a pa rt of the  university   community .   There are no barriers to the completion of this area of improvement other than time spent  putting together educational materia ls, seminars, and/or workshops.   Follow ing up with the  researchers who   have requested these materials on their satisfaction and on future areas of  concern are   key to addressing this issue.  Another way measure success will be the attendance  and participat ion of  university   researchers.  The main barriers to s uccess will be gett ing the word  to interested researchers and offering enough opportunities for all to  attend ,   given con flicts in  time and commitments.   3.2  Point of contact for industry   A  key area of the   w orkshop was the discu ssion of innovation on campus.  The discussion  revolved around t he two mechanisms of innovation:   push vs. pull. Historically ,   innovation on  campus has been pushed.   An example of p ushing innovation would be having innovation led by  the process of writing grants an d other funding opportunities.  Innovatio n and invention is formed  aro und those grants and pushed  to industry to see if these innovations can fit   framework.  Pull   innovation w ould be to have industry work   with  university   researchers to  det ermine   areas of industry concern and f or  the researc hers to address those concerns.  Researchers   can then either have industry fund the research or draft grant proposals around  
p1592
aV  20   |  Page     indust ry - relevant types of research. Engaged stakeholders would then pull i nnovations and  i nventions from the  universi ty   into industry.   A key to having more pull   innovation would be   researcher comfort and   communication with  industry as well as   industry having easy contact and communication with  the  university .   The  following questions   did   score  as high as other questions  f or both internal and external  stakeholder assessment:   The institution promotes openness, accessibility, and responsiveness by: designating one entity  as a first point of contact for industry and economic development agencies.   The  university   plans   to address this issue by c reating the Division of Research and Econ omic  Development and inform ing   exter nal stakeholders and industry.   The researchers and departments  will be encouraged to seek out and continue to communicate with industry independently, b ut  this  division will give the  university   a  formal starting point for researchers to find a portal out to  industry and industry a portal into  the  university .   A seco nd aspect of encouraging pull   innovation  is a  TTO expansion in marketing   and industry  connec tion.   As   part of the Division of Research  and Economic Development , the TTO will be more active   in planning events  tha t   connect   researchers to  industry ,   such as the 2014 Livestock Biotech Summit. This  require s   the TTO to  work closely with departments to make proper industrial contacts and help start relevant  conversations between  university   researchers   and industrial researchers.  Measureable outcomes  include increased invention  disclosure  to the TTO, increased  agreement s with industry, and  increased sponsored r esearch and licensing   as industry pulls the technology out   of the  university .   The  university  collaborative, entrepreneurial work that  ma y not lead directly to startups   but which still can  contribute to marketable ideas and innovations. The Translational Cancer Research Center brings  together the pharmacists developing new drug therapies and delivery system with the physicians  and practit ioners on the front lines delivering patient care. As the lead institution on the  Biochemical Spatiotemporal NeTwork Resource Center, or BioSNTR, the  university   brings  together the talents of scientists working with plants, animals, and humans from five un iversities  and two health care institutions, bioinformatics experts and unique tools that allow them to  explore the inner workings of the cells. The  university  
p1593
aV  21   |  Page     research centers focused on developing engineering materia ls will provide important links to  industry in the region and across the nation.    It will be important for  Division of Research and  Economic Development   and the TTO to  remain engaged with these c enters so that they can have  the industry connection and participation needed in order to meet research center goals.     Successfully addressing this issue will be key in making it easier for industry to connect with  the  university . P ublicizing the  new divi    name change and increasing TTO activity   will be  the main issues to overcome.  Success will be measured by the increase in industry agreements,  licenses, collaborations, and by polling external stakeholders on the ease and satisfaction in  university   r elationships.  This task will need continual monitoring and update s   and will not b e  completed and forgotten.  The main barriers for success are the constant need to work  successful ly in getting the  Division of Research and Economic Development   name  in the pu blic,  the need for increased support to provide the services needed by  Division of Research and  Economic Development   and the TTO, and outreach to research centers to keep them engaged  with the  university   and industry.   3.3  Optimizing the website and social  media to engage stakeholders and students   The university website has been   housed in  the  U niversity Marketing and   Communications  office   since fall 2013 . Discussions  regarding overall   Web governance and management   are  ongoing .   Among   the objectives  of the talks is  to  identify ways to  more broadly leverag e   existing UMC  and university  resources , which will  better highlight  university   research, accomplishments,  experts and stories across the website, social media and other   internal and external   outlets .   The  site can serve as a portal not only into the  university   but also into the Division of Research and  Economic Development.   Key to that effort will be creation of an SDSU News Center web portal  a central  information  hub able to easily feed content to oth er areas of the website  for example,  department, college or administrative pages.  The  SDSU  News Center  will   integrate seamlessly  with social media and email newsletters to   allow for increased finding   of inform ation for external  stakeholders .   For example, t he Division of Resear ch and Economic Development and   TTO  pages  could   include   vid eo stories of faculty and  students working   in SDIP - launc hed start ups,   features

Building the  SDSU  News Center   require s   upgrades and changes to the existing  web site   content management system (CMS)  in order to d eliver   the necessary  improvements - f or example,  a mobile - friendly design   and a more user - friendly i nterface for the more than 200 W eb editors on  campus .   UMC and Web t eam leadership are negotiating  the terms and details of  that  implementation and other changes that will help bring sdstate.edu into line with peers and  industry best practices, as  part of the ongoing discussions regarding Web governance and  management.   Focus should remain, both from a   news and marketing  perspective, on the  efforts  about   access to  undergraduate research opportunities  being   a p ositive differentiator for the  university .  It   not only can  help attract  students,  but also prepare them   for graduate school   and   give them a  competitive edge when applying to professional programs, graduate school s   or entering the job  market.

aV  27   |  Page     Appendix III   APLU CICEP Workshop Results   April 16, 2014   The APLU  workshop   was held  April 16, 2014 ,   in   the Lohr Building in Room T3.  The participants broke into  groups to facilitate the discussion of various topics and were welcomed by  South Dakota State  University President  David  L.  Chicoine.   Will Aylor then gave some background information on the  p rogram and how  it   aligns with  current   u niversity goals i n economic development and the u niversity  lan , IMPACT 2018 .   The groups were then given the first  topic, which   was a discussion of the university in economic d evelopment ,   including the role of South Dakota State University i n   regional economic development. W hat are the expectations,  and what are some examples of areas of strength and areas for improvement i n regional economic development?   Some of the roles of the u niversity in economic development include   d evelop ing workforce,   research,  consulting, knowledge and technology generation, and business recruitment.   O ther important aspects are the  u niversity engagement in the community ,   including the  university   itself as a job creator, the impact of student  spending in the community,   and the impact of ancillary jobs such as spousal emplo yment for  university   employees.   Expectations of the  university   include the development of intellectual property and the transfer of such property, the  development of both basic and applied research pro grams, and the ability to help take  university   technology through  the valley of death (when appropriate) to help facilitate new compa ny formation or licensing.   One important aspect  of innovation is the ability to get an idea from the bench to the market an d all the sc aling steps along the pathway.  There is a need to complement the push process of  technology, which   happens when grants push ideas through a  laboratory with a pull process in which industry is pulling ideas out of the l aboratory to fill market n eeds.   This  process needs researchers communicating with industry and the  university   should strive to make connections and  find needs that research can be built around to solve.   Degrees and programs should be supplying workers   to meet i ndustry needs .  Consultation by  university   researchers can serve local industry needs and improve  the success of local industry.  An engaged  university   should  improve the quality of life in the community.   Another area of discussion is the interplay between consultation and   South Dakota  B oard of  R egent s (SDBOR)   policy on intellectual property   and conflicts of i nterest and how they interplay.   The idea of a training worksh op on  this topic was discussed.   Also discussed was the desire to have a portal that allows for those in in dustry to b e able to  better find the expertise, equipment and  facilities they may need so that those in the market can search for ways to  solve problems using the  university .   The second topi c for group discussion was the seven   APLU principles of economic e ngagement and  the  university    1.   Engaging and assert ing institutional leadership.   a.

aVTechnology Transfer  Office   (TTO)   in 2008 ,   which helped establish the need and execution for similar offices in the  South Dakota  School of Mine s and the University of South  D akota . Another area of discussion  was how can the  univers ity   plan for the future ,   especially in the area of administrative changes  either  at the  university   or the  SD BOR institutions.  The institutionalization of the economic  development processes and goals need to be captured as different administrations may have   different goals, expe riences, and desired outcomes.  The  university   may have solid footing now,  but changes in leadership ca n cause changes in priorities.  An example of  university   success is the

Th e groups emphasized the need for  stories and examples of success to show  university   and  external stakeholders the value being created at the  university   a nd encourage  future innovation.   Another idea was to bring in an outside entity to  review the economic s tudy produced by the  SDBOR   in September 2010 as to  how the  university   positively enhances the local, regional, 1 - 29,  state, and national economies.     3.   Ensuring that Uni versit y activities benefit the public.   Not discussed.   4.   Contributing to the devel opment of an innovation economy.   Among the advances discussed was the creation of the  TTO   in 2008 a nd building the Research Park   at  South Dakota State University .  Future  projects include the b ioscience initi ative   and the Ag Tech C enter.   5.   Providing relevant educati onal opportunities and programs.   a.   The groups pointed to the different le vel of programs from entry to Ph. D .   and new programs that  are tied to economic d evelopment w ith the example of precision agriculture   and how industry is  providing input in curriculum b ased on needs of the industry.  The groups also  noted   that  sponsored research is integrated with e ducation and that more industry - relevant majors enable the  departme nts to collaborate more efficiently and effec tively with industry partners.  F urther  importance is the informal public education provided by the  university   by SDSU Extension,  Engineering Extension and EpSCoR and the great success  of those programs/departmen ts.   6.   Promoting openness, accessibility, and responsiveness;   a.   One key point was the need for  TOO  education  or workshops  on the decision making on whether  to file or not file the patent and marketing the technology .  The groups also stressed the continuing  need   to get into the labs of active res earch faculty who   are not disclosing to make persona l  relationships with them   in an effort  to alleviate conc erns and make disclosure easy.   7.   Communicating contributions, successes, and achievements that benefit the region.   The  university   has  to identify stakeholders and   target audience s   which can be different depending   on the  university   department.  The next stop is developing a matrix (numeric/performance indicators) to show  those  stakeholders relevant results.  The  universit y   also needs to get success stories out to those stakeholders  to inform the m and allow those individuals   to carry the message forward.  The  university   can measure  success through increases in revenues, job creation, and others adopting our practic es develop ed at the  university .   The adoption of pr actices may be industry wide or helping improve an aspect of a process for a  single stakeholder, but when others adopt  university   practices it benefits both the adopting party and the  university .     Next, each group   wor ked on an area of the APLU s urvey that either received a low score or had a large gap  between importance and performance to discuss how that area could be   improved or the gap lessened.    Group 1:   The institution promotes openness, accessibility, and  responsiveness by: maintainin g user - friendly portals and  web sites to search for fac ulty and staff expertise and research and development   facilities. (3.54)   
p1607
aV  29   |  Page     The first step is to admit that this is the lowest score and that this proble m must be addressed and fixed.  Ideas  for solutions include decision trees that could be created to fix the  technology problem .  A human component must  also be addressed as people and companies are getting lost knowing who m to contact. There needs to be o ne  central  source for busine sses to find people and  resources.  Data  mine the hits and searches on the web site   so that the  university   can respond to areas  of significant searching and  need s .  External groups cannot use our website easily as   colleges and departments. A formal head to deal with external groups and be the key central  person for contact would help to fix the problem s.  The  university   should also be looking into getting the word out  about our resources and people and may want to ex plore how to use social medi a to address these problems.   Group 2:   The institution promotes openness, accessibility, and responsiveness by: designating one entity as a first point  of contact for industry and economic development agencies.   One solution  offer ed by the group is the renaming of the Office of Vice President of Research to include  economic development such as the Division of Research and Economic Development.   This gives external groups a  more c lear idea of where to conne ct.  The renami ng would need   to be publicized.   It is also critically important that  faculty members know that they can and should be a first point of contact with relevant industry,   but they can also  inform the vice president of the newly named division   when they need to move forward   with such contacts into an  agreement such as sponsored research, collaboration,  or a non - disclosure agreement.  Online,  web, and social media  presence s  are  needed so that a company can search and find relevant information about  university   perso nnel,  facilities and  equipment.  SDSU Extension can be a   great first point of contact.  A topic for future consideration is t he  establishment of a research f oundation.   Group 3:   The institution provides relevant educationa l opportunities and programs by   creat ing a culture of  entrepreneurship across the institution, including training and mentoring opportunities for students and faculty.   The first area the group discu ssed is what are the respondent s    thoughts on entrepreneurship and the spirit  v ersu s   actually c reating businesses.   The group pointed out that being entrepreneurial is not only found in business  formation, but  also in many of the activities  university   personnel undertak e daily.  This score could be a  communication issue and the education on t his topic   could provide value.  Also ,   student business competitions are  plentiful and provide students the opportunity to learn the basics of business planning and starting a business while  potentially   being rewarded for that work.  The group also discussed whether f aculty incentives might not be high  enough espe cially for non - tenured faculty.   The group further discussed whether cross - discipline programs would  help to encourage students from all walks of campus to take advantage of available entrepreneurial programs.     The w orkshop provided many ideas for ways to address  university   involvement in economic developme nt,  innovation, and prosperity.   Some of these were:   1.   Conflict of interest workshops for researchers and graduate students;   2.   Seminars or talks by the  TTO   on the  decision - making processes involved at the TTO for filing patents,  how technologies are marketed, and what happens after a license is signed to a researchers rights to use  the technology;   3.   Education on entrepreneurial activities that go beyond starting a bus iness to show the entrepreneurial  spirit on campus f  up using  E ntrepreneur  I n  R esidence - type   activities to  w ork with small and large groups   and try to communicate to those on the fence on these types of  activities;

aVINTRODUCTION  The Research Foundation for The State University of New York (RF), the largest university-connected  research foundation in the nation, provides the leadership, organizational infrastructure, and stewardship necessary  to successfully administer over $1 billion in research activity and provide innovation, entrepreneurship, and   commercialization support to the State University of New York (SUNY) enterprise. SUNY is the largest  comprehensive system of higher education in the country. With 64 campuses and a presence in every county of New   tched to any other education institution in the country and so are the  challenges faced by a system of this magnitude.    The Power of SUNY   improve economic impact. The RF launched a state-wide system of innovation programs known collectively as  SUNY- INC  that leverages  The Power of SUNY  to further the development and creation of new ideas, companies  and jobs by providing programs, support, coordination and assistance across a platform of state-wide higher  education and research. Over the last three years the RF developed and administered multiple new initiatives, some  of which have had early and immediate success, and all of which promise to take the SUNY system, and the st ate of New York, to the next plateau of technology based economic development.    THE ECONOMIC ENGAGEMENT ENTERPRISE   SUNY-INC  brings together the people    ract nearly $1 billion in sponsored research  funding every year. The innovations emerging from this research portfolio cover a broad range of disciplines and  industrial sectors, from medical devices to computer chips, advanced manufacturing methods and clean energy  technology. The RF, through its newly developed  Office of Innovation and Partnerships , plays a significant role in  the support and development of key programs and services, all of which provide guidance and business support, as  well as access to space, scientists and research equipment needed to advance innovation and create new products,  applications and jobs. Each initiative launched or in development is focused on advancing innovation in five phases

aVof the  . Each phase   below.   RF Innovation Continuum    Phase   Description  Phase 1:  Research & Discovery  It all begins with the research conducted by SUNY faculty, staff and students  across the system. SUNY  research is a major producer of intellectual capital   technology transfer offices in 2012, SUNY is among the top three intellectual  property producing universities in the state, and has co nsistently maintained   the RF recognize the potential for further collaboration among its campuses.    SUNY and the RF developed the  Research Collaboration Fund  to capitalize on the  power of SUNY systemness 1 by encouraging new and  existing inter -campus collaborations and supporting their development into  long term partnerships with sustained growth. The RF also launched  the  Faculty Research Travel Grant  program to provide for financia l support to  faculty who travel to advocate for their programs in advance of submitting  proposals.  Phase 2:  Technology  Development  In order to assist SUNY campuses achieve greater economic impacts based  on research activities, the RF developed a  regional ized innovation  support model     Technology Accelerator Fund  (TAF) provides funding fo r select SUNY -developed technologies to  accelerate their development and commercialization. TAF is a competitive,  enterprise -wide program that funds proof -of-concept projects to prime   -impact commercialization. Th e RF also leveraged the power of the SUNY system to broker deals with a  number of different  market intelligence services  so that innovation support  staff across the system could have access to the latest sources of market  data and information in furtheranc e of their objectives to market new  innovations coming out of SUNY. The  Innovation Keystone  provides a  centralized repository of information including forms, templates, agreements,  best practices and other information relevant to technology  commercializati on and business incubation that enables communication  across boundaries while staying relevant to current trends and issues.  Phase 3:  Business Development  The RF facilitates and forms collaborative public -private partnerships that  support economic develo pment and entrepreneurial opportunities. The RF   SUNY Incubator  Network , and a number of collaborative research ventures. The focus of this  stage of the continuum is to provide services to SUNY startup comp anies  that are formed to commercialize SUNY -developed technologies or

aVthese young companies become successful. The RF supports the  SUNY  Insure  program, which reduces the administrativ e burden for new start -ups  affiliated with SUNY programs and facilities by reducing costs associated  with obtaining requisite insurance policies.  The SUNY  Entrepreneur in  Residence  program that will help us make better use of SUNY alumni and  other regiona l business people as the writers of business plans for startups  and mentors to entrepreneurial faculty and students.  The RF offers its  Innovation Community Chest , a collection of best -in-class products and  services, to SUNY commercialization professionals  across the system.  This  constantly evolving suite of critical tools and services ensures that SUNY  staff and the business community that is services have access to the critical  intelligence needed to commercialize SUNY research, while our one -point  procurement approach saves SUNY campuses hundreds of thousands of  dollars every year.  Phase 4:  Growth & Expansion  With government, business and industrial partners, researchers advance  knowledge, discovery and innovation that can translate into real solutions  to   and information technology, and have a major economic impact, creating  jobs and new commercial products. The problem is attracting those partners  to invest in SUNY companies, th us the RF launched the  SUNY Innovation  Showcase  to connect New York venture capital with selected companies  and provide the opportunity to engage with additional sources of seed and  venture funding whereby assisting in the potential growth of these  compani es. This Showcase features over 25 growing companies and a  select group of interested venture firms looking to make investments in New  York companies.  Phase 5:  Strategic Partnerships   new opportunities emerge for partnerships with industry across the state, the  RF engages in strategic partnerships that not only inform the SUNY  innovation agenda but also support an improved academic environment for  students through experiential learning an d targeted programs which produce  students who are more marketable to industry when they graduate. The RF  is currently developing  industry incentive programs  and streamlined  partnership agreements  to provide improved access to university facilities  as well  as standardized terms with respect to intellectual property ownership.   Each phase of the continuum is integrated within and among various corporate strategic initiatives that  serve as a means of grounding the individual strategic objectives of each discrete initiative or program. Throughout  each program implemented the RF stresses the need for expertise, transparency and clarity. It is with these guiding  principles in mind that the RF has begun to pave the way for a new and enhanced innovation ecosystem throughout  the entirety of the SUNY system.

Stakeholder Analysis : Integration of system- wide program support services is not without its challenges. A key  driver for early success for many of these new programs, and what will help sustain    track record going  forward, is an ability to conduct stakeholder analyses and respond to external input. For each area of the continuum  stakeholder groups serve as key focus groups and test beds for new program development and deployment. These  groups provide vehicles for concept validation, program adjustment and metrics to track success. These groups have   help refine concepts, change course, or abandon efforts   external and internal constituencies is essential as the system moves forward with SUNY-INC. Directed  communications and focused meetings allows feedback to be easily received which allows leadership to understand    perceive    Expertise:  In each program discrete sources of expertise are applied, validated by stakeholder groups, which may  help leadership avoid pitfalls or address challenges that are bound to arise as any new programs are launched. This   expertise gives the necessary credibility with constituent groups.  Transparency:  In a system of the magnitude of SUNY trust is an absolute imperative, but by no means an easy  quality to develop or maintain. Only by being fully transparent about planning, budgeting, implementation and  tracking systems can the trust necessary for us to be effective in our efforts to have a meaningful and lasting impact    develop.  Clarity:  Clarity is relevant across all areas   clarity in communications, clarity of purpose, clarity of scope and  outcome. SUNY must achieve clarity in all of these in order to be successful. There is a tendency to take on too  much too quickly without first building the infrastructure to handle the increased volumes that would no doubt result

aVfrom improved program offerings. It is necessary have the discipline to be clear about near term objectives and how  these objectives, if done right, would enable long-term and more lasting success es.    undergoing a system-wide stakeholder analysis and making being be transparent clear to all external and internal   objectives need to be organized, consistent, and purposeful so all stakeholders can easily recognize the impacts their  local SUNY campus is making on their local economy. The CICEP Assessment Tools provide SUNY and its external  and internal stakeholders a standardized form of data collection that enables SUNY to illustrate how it is taking steps  to improve and communicate its economic engagement broadly. This first year establishes a baseline that is used to    to create a performance improvement plan.    ECONOMIC ENGAGEMENT PLANNING  SUNY and the RF have adopted as its first objective a set of strategies called   Base.  SUNY can learn from those public-university systems that have gotten smarter and more aggressive about  attracting the kind of research dollars that lead to industry partnerships and that generate the kind of knowledge   leading to more economic engagement, technology transfer,  and startup opportunities.    and the RF convened a new  SUNY Research Council  comprising the best  and brightest advisors we can find, including alumni and faculty with experience in industry and in other public-  university systems. This council is writing our first-ever strategic research plan aligned with federal and private  funding priorities. Through  the Research Collaboration Fund , SUNY and the RF will catalyze major research  proposals that cross our campuses, so we can be competitive for funding opportunities where no single campus has  enough capability to carry the day against our larger competitors.    SUNY and the RF have adopted a second major objective we call  Building an Entrepreneurial Culture . In broadest terms, SUNY and RF want to learn from the most nimble public systems nationally how to remove barriers   revolutionary  START-UP NY  initiative.  Under the plan, new and existing companies that relocate to unused space in

A third strategy, adopted by SUNY and the RF is called  Anchoring Regional Economies . Even in those  regions where there is no prominent SUNY economic development presence, we want to serve as a committed  partner, a role model for the private institutions, and a convener.   Various SUNY campuses already host relevant assets:  Small Business Development Centers , business  incubators of all varieties, and a significant number of the  Centers for Advanced Technology  and Centers of  Excellence   NYSTAR). To ensure its commitment to external stakeholders is realized SUNY will actively measure how industry   perceives us, through a survey partnership with the Business Council of New York State; facilitate one-stop industry  service in each region, through a designated lead who knows exactly what each campus in the region can bring to a  partnership and how to use the master agreements that have been developed; strengthen the connections of each     Regional Economic Development Councils; and emphasize that any asset anywhere in across  the system is available to any New York business in any other region, regardless of regional boundaries.

No one will ever know all the individual executives, investors and  entrepreneurs whose decisions we hope to affect, but by working harder and smarter at innovation and   marketed by the Governor and Empire State Development Corporation. SUNY and the RF propose have proposed  that the Cuomo administration measure our progress through metrics developed by   2 expressly for the  purpose of accountability.   SUNY has internally branded the   new metrics as   Metrics and we will implement them in a phase approached that will ensure the people, process, and technology are  aligned to capture and report on these new measures.  COMMUNICATE BROADLY   d to tell others about it.  Only by working closely with internal  and external communication venues can stories of SUNY research, innovation, and economic engagement reach the  public. Our audiences are not only local and regional communities within New York State, but also national and  international communities across the nation and globe. SUNY and the RF hope to reach every community through   coordinated news releases and  a social media presence.  The goal is to elevate the profile of SUNY research  innovation and its role of being a leader in economic development activities at the state, national, and international   levels. The impacts that the SUNY Innovation Ecosystem is making to statewide economic growth can only be   recognized by internal and external groups by becoming a reliable and predictable source of information.

aVWHY SUNY IS THE BEST  As an institution of statewide  scope , SUNY has assets generally within 30 minutes of any center of  economic activity. As a single institution under unified statewide governance, we face no inherent limits on  coordination. SUNY can reach across our system for the necessary resources   whether R&D-based, instructional,  or mid-skills training  far better than any private institution can collaborate with others in like circumstances.

SUNY  offers  experience . The system hosts a significant plurality of the  assets and programs in which the State has already invested considerable sums to support academic/industrial  collaboration: six Centers of Excellence, six Centers for Advanced Technology, and 18 high-technology and bio-  The Power of  SUNY 3 demonstrates a clear  vision  and commitment for contributing to economic development based on knowledge  and innovation. Generally, any public-university system   by virtue of its size, geographic reach, and inherent  obligations to the taxpayers who fund it   offers unique advantages as a full partner to a Governor working at  economic development.    SUNY will set the standard for aggressive interaction with industry, experimentation with innovative models  for technology transfer and commercialization, and overall unapologetic commitment to economic development.  When a Governor is working on a big economic-development prospect, it is almost always the leader of the public  institution that stands willingly at his or her side. SUNY can do the same for our state and our Governor. Under new  leadership SUNY and the RF, have begun to address past weaknesses, and can go farther and faster if the state   embraces SUNY as a full and active partner in the innovation-economy. SUNY can bridge the gaps among the 10  regions and help New York State make more of the whole than the sum of the parts.  SUNY and the RF commit not only to deliver better results than ever inside our own system, but to develop  and model best practices for those regions where private knowledge institutions take the lead.

aV  SUNY and the Entrepreneurial Century  Goals  Entrepreneurial Century activities span the entire research enterprise, reach every corner of New York State, and aim  to:    1)   .  Growing sponsored research brings federal dollars back into New York , creates new highly paid jobs, builds infrastructure, and generates discoveries that lead to innovation and the   centers, technical colleges, university colleges, and community colleges each have an important role to play   in a focused regional research efforts. To increase competitiveness, SUNY must stimulate faculty   collaborations, help identify potential partners, and develop programs to support collaborative research   programs within SUNY.    2) Build an entrepreneurial culture.   SUNY will build linkages among existing projects and partners and add  new participants in a system-wide suite of courses, grants, and mentorship programs that will foster more  entrepreneurial campus cultures and support students and faculty in moving discoveries and ideas into the  marketplace  to generate jobs, income, and prosperity. Each aspect of SUNY Start-up will incorporate  participation and guidance from entrepreneurs who are members of the community, alumni, or have  connections to the SUNY campuses.   3) Anchor regional economies.  SUNY campuses anchor regional economies and facilitate company growth  and development through innovation, technology transfer, small business development programs, major  research assets, and workforce training. To be successful, this model has to be collaborative not only     and private economic development and planning agencies, business organizations, and non-profits.  Long-term Outcomes  SUNY, in collaboration with its partners across government, academia, and industry, will make significant investment  and progress toward a sustainable future for New York  innovation economy.  With respect to the three over-arching  Entrepreneurial Century goals, SUNY will achieve the following long-term outcomes:   SUNY system-wide assets leveraged as common practice to capture large-scale federal funding   opportunities and strategic private sector partnerships.   Faculty, students, and staff benefit from comprehensive support to advance their academic pursuits and  entrepreneurial aspirations.   SUNY is the one-stop shop for academic research and development (R&D), entrepreneurial training,   workforce development, and small business development programs.

aV 6   APPENDIX A   Key Entrepreneurial Century Investment Area Details  SUNY Research Council and Strategic Plan for SUNY Research  Primary Entrepreneurial Century Goal Supported:  Goal 1 -    Challenge : The critical components that businesses of all sizes and stages need knowledge, talent, and expertise  can all be found  at SUNY. SUNY has $1 billion annually in research expenditures, more than 10,000 research projects across 64 campuses, significant  infrastructure, strong existing partnerships, and some of the best faculty and students in the world. The challenge is how  to best  leverage these assets to advance research  and increase funding.  Goal : A council of experts working to provide guidance on research direction, funding allocations, research compliance, and research  and development catalyst programs to support the growth of sponsored research.  Approach:    Establish the council starting with SUNY members. Total membership will be 17 members. The membership will be drawn  from distinguished researchers and senior level campus officers within SUNY and a significant number of prominent external   researchers.  The Council will be balanced and diverse with representation from a variety of disciplines, from a variety of  organizations   academia, industry, government   and from both early career stars and more seasoned veterans.    candidates.   Broaden the council with the addition of external experts in various disciplines.   Task the council with serving as an advisory council to the  SUNY Board of Trustees , the  Research Foundation Board of  Directors , the  SUNY Provost , and Campus Presidents  to:  Set strategies that encourage and nurture research as one of the primary missions of the University.    Define principles that govern research throughout the system.    Examine research strengths throughout SUNY and suggest opportunities for collaboration and growth.     Advise and make recommendations on system policies relating to research and research funding.    Monitor and advise on system processes, data, and tools that support research and research collaborations.   Current Status:  The council is staffed with SUNY and faculty members . Two external members have accepted and others are  currently being solicited.
p1635
aV  Research Collaboration Fund  Primary Entrepreneurial Century Goal Supported:  Goal 1-   partnership base  Challenge:  SUNY conducts approximately one quarter of the university-based research volume in New York, with 90,000 faculty, staff  and students and nearly $1B in sponsored research. SUNY has six New York state designated centers of excellence, six centers for   advanced technology, and 11 business incubators. A healthy innovation ecosystem must connect the people, technology and   infrastructure to support and advance research growth.  Goal:  Increase competitive SUNY research proposals to federal and other funding agencies.  Approach:  Establish a fund focused on interdisciplinary, multi-investigator, multi-campus research projects and pilot studies needed to  generate preliminary results and data necessary to provide a basis for, or add credibility to, more advanced, larger-scale proposals for  future funding:   The proposing entity must be a SUNY campus collaborating with at least one other SUNY university center or doctoral degree  granting institution, medical center, comprehensive or technology college. (Community colleges may participate, but the  collaboration must include at least two of the previously mentioned SUNY campus types). Non-SUNY entities are permitted to  provide cost sharing to the proposal but no funds can be provided to these entities.   A proposal must be interdisciplinary. Interdisciplinary research is a mode of research by teams or individuals that integrates   information, data, techniques, tools, perspectives, concepts, and/or theories from two or more disciplines or bodies of   specialized knowledge to advance fundamental understanding or to solve problems whose solutions are beyond the scope of  a single discipline or area of research practice.  Current Status:  Awards will be made in September 2012. A faculty review committee by discipli ne, supported by the RF Catalyst  Committee, will review proposals and make the awards.
p1636
aV  Faculty Travel Grant Program  Primary Entrepreneurial Century Goal Supported:  Goal 1 -    Challenge:  With federal funding of research projected to decline in the coming years, competition for such grants will increase . Faculty  who interact with prospective sponsors learn how to better structure research proposals and increase the likelihood of their proposals  being funded.  Goal:  Make SUNY faculty more competitive for federal research grants.  Approach:  The SUNY and the Entrepreneurial Century Team will fund a pilot travel grant program at $20,000. Under the pilot program,  SUNY faculty will be eligible to compete for twenty grants of up to $1,000 that help defray the cost of travel to attend meetings with  program officers at federal funding agencies.  The program is based on similar initiatives implemented at research universities and states across the country that aim to improve the  competitiveness of faculty research proposals.     
p1637
aV  Pilot Entrepreneurs in Residence (EIR) Programs  Primary Entrepreneurial Century Goal Supported:   Goal 2 - Build an entrepreneurial culture  Challenge:  Translating research discovery  into companies that operate and create jobs in New York State.  Goal:   -generated  innovation.   Approach:  Develop an Entrepreneur- in-Residence (EIR) program designed to help identify potential breakthroughs and provide in- house experience to generate viable business plans:   Provide regional innovation hubs with access to the time and skills of proven, private-sector entrepreneurs who have both  start-up experience     The RF will recruit, certify, and make available to the research-oriented campuses a roster of skilled business people who will   EIRs.    These EIRs will work with faculty inventors, small business development centers, technology-transfer professionals, motivated   academic graduate students, business and law students, business people already involved in other SUNY research assets,  and the statewide business and financial communities to:   Identify the business-development and technology-development milestones that must be met in order to convert a  discovery-based idea into a business.   Provide early leadership of this process on campus, ev en before a spinoff is formed.   Help ensure that the eventual start-up is well positioned to attract the outside capital and executive and managerial talent  that will allow it to survive, thrive, and grow to its largest possible scale as a local employer.
p1638
aV  Technology Accelerator Fund (TAF)  Primary Entrepreneurial Century Goal Supported:  Goal 2 - Build an entrepreneurial culture  Challenge:  A material barrier to the commercialization of university technology is the lack of funding for promising technologies after  sponsor support ends and before the technology is mature enough for licensing. Funding at this stage is essential to translat e promising discoveries that may be ground-breaking or have broad potential implications for the public benefit, but will languish without   funding.   Goal:  Continue to provide funding for select technologies to accelerate their development and commercialization.  Approach:  TAF 2013 and 2014 are the next iteration of the successful 2011 TAF model, which resulted in two licensed technologies , three start-up companies with mature management teams, and one SBIR award.  TAF   egic  objective is to facilitate the transfer of SUNY-developed technology and public availability of promising new technologies in an  expeditious and effective manner,  and identify opportunities where small investments will make a significant impact on making SUNY  technologies available to the public.  Awards may be made up to $50,000, but projects will be funded at the level deemed necessary to achieve the proposed project  objectives. The evaluation and award process includes a rigorous budget review. The project plan and budget of any submitte d proposal may be negotiated by the TAF Managing Director before an award is made.   In return for its investments, TAF receives 10% of the gross revenue received by SUNY from the licensing or other commercialization  of TAF-supported technology. In addition, TAF is funded by RF and campus contributions.
p1639
aV  NSF I-CORPS Program  Primary Entrepreneurial Century Goal Supported:  Goal 2 - Build an entrepreneurial culture  Challenge:  Life-changing discovery is taking place at SUNY campuses across New York State .  However, only one Startup Company  is produced per $200M annual research volume.  In contrast, MIT has a finely tuned its innovation ecosystem to produce more than 80  start-ups per $200M research volume.  Goal:  Accelerate and encourage the entrepreneurial  process through low-cost intervention.  Approach:  Establish a process for SUNY   I-CORPS program proposals.   I-CORPS is a program created by NSF to broaden the impact of select, NSF-funded, basic-research projects by preparing scientists  and engineers to extend their focus beyond the laboratory.  I-CORPS is explicitly designed to teach entrepreneurship and bring  entrepreneurs, venture capital providers, and researchers together to propel new research discoveries into the marketplace.    I-Corps Nodes are designed to support regional needs for innovation education, infrastructure, and research. The Nodes work  cooperatively to build, utilize, and sustain a national innovation ecosystem that further enhances the development of technologies,  products, and processes that benefit society.

aV  SUNY Patents and Inventions Policy Board (PIPB)  Primary Entrepreneurial Century Goal Supported:  Goal 2 - Build an entrepreneurial culture  Challenge:  Commercialization activities   disclosure of a new invention, assessment of its  patentability and commercial potential,  protection, and marketing   often involve complex legal agreements and corporate risk .   Goal:  Establish a board of experts to implement and clarify the policies that guide innovation and commercialization activity at SUNY.  This board will implement and clarify the policy, address possible conflicts of interest arising out of commercialization activities, and  seal intellectual property leaks from the system.   Approach : Establish a board to have no more than 10 members, including one representative of SUNY system administration, two  from the university centers, one from the health sciences centers, one from another major research institution of the university, one  from the colleges of arts and sciences, one from the agriculture and technology colleges, one from the Research Foundation, and two  representatives from business and industry. The board may invite additional members to serve in a non-voting advisory capacity.  The patents and inventions policy board will:  1. Undertake continual review of the patents and inventions, copyright, computer software, conflict of interest, and related  intellectual property and commercialization policies applicable to SUNY.  2. Advise the Chancellor, the SUNY Board of Trustees, and the RF Board of Directors regarding:   guidelines and procedures for the implementation of these policies;   exceptions to these policies in unusual circumstances;    determining the extent of the university's interest in inventions;    determining whether or not to grant exclusive licenses or to commit the university to the future granting of exclusive  licenses as a condition of sponsorship for research projects;   issue recommendations for interpretation of or revisions to existing policies, or the creation of new policies; and   such other matters as the Chancellor may deem appropriate.  Current Status:  The board is staffed and meeting.

aV  Business Council Survey   Primary Entrepreneurial Century Goal Supported:  Goal 3 - Anchoring regional economies  Challenge:  Experts have identified several different ways in which colleges and universities might be able to help businesses  and promote economic growth in their communities. Feedback from the business community can provide input on   in New York State economic development.  Goal:  Obtain feedback from businesses in New York State   the   economic growth and revitalization.  Approach:  Develop a survey to gather feedback from the New York State business community:   Distribute an  eight-item questionnaire to gather basic information from business community about what they think is most  important for SUNY institutions to do   and what their experience with SUNY has been to date.   Analyze survey results.   Align Entrepreneurial Century portfolio with business community feedback.

aVAPLU CICEP Case Study 1 SUNY\u2122s Technology Accelerator Fund (TAF)   Background:  The State University of New York (SUNY) is at the center of efforts to revitalize New York\u2122s  economy and lead the Entrepreneurial Century.  SUNY\u2122s Business incubators, Centers of Excellence, Centers for Advanced Technology and other collaborative research ventures populate economic   development regions across New York State and ar e built on the strength of the SUNY research  community.  They foster entrepreneurial campus cultures and support students and faculty in moving discoveries and ideas into the marketplace.  SUNY\u2122s TAF complements these initiatives.
p1643
aVSUNY\u2122s TAF is a program designed to attract entrepreneurs and early stage capital to New York, and focuses on closing the funding gap that exists after basic research funding ends and before a viable and investable company is operating.  Funding at this stage is essential to bring to market promising discoveries that may be ground-breaking with broad potential implications fo r the benefit of the public that would otherwise fail due to the lack of funding.  TAF provides relief to this inherent barrier by tapping into SUNY\u2122s assets and expertise, and by working with  SUNY\u2122s commercialization ecosystem, will identify  where strategic investments can make a significant  impact on moving products and services to the market for the public benefit.TAF is a program that build s on SUNY\u2122s commercialization efforts and is modeled  after successful similar programs at other institutions, where targeted support has proven effective in helping to bridge the gaps and resulted in substantial economic impact.  Objectives: The three overarching objectives of TAF are:   1. To assist the SUNY Innovation Engine in  reaching greater potential by facilitating the commercialization of SUNY\u2122s intellectual assets; 2. To promote and cultivate an entrepreneurial culture at SUNY; and 3. To build stronger relationships with industry and investment communities.   The TAF program is designed to support SUNY\u2122s most promising technologies in overcoming the funding gap that exists after research funding ends and further \ufb01proof-of-concept\ufb02 is necessary to establish that a technology is commercially viable, to prove its value, and to reduce the risk for industry or investors.  In order to meet this objective TAF  will fund specific projects that are capable of accelerated development and  commercialization.  For these selected innovative discoveries, TAF will provide grants and partner with  faculty to expedite their readiness for transfer to the market for the public benefit.   Impacts and Outcomes: Since the launch of the TAF in 2011, the program has successfully advanced the commercial readiness of 16 of SUNY-developed innovations.  The TA F has invested over $1.1 million dollars in SUNY\u2122s  most promising technologies and the fund will be receivi ng its first return on investment this summer.  The following occurred as a direct result of  the awarded to projects through the TAF:   
p1644
aV1. Startup companies were creat ed around two of the technologies to commercialize TAF- supported technologies and are operating today; ls; and 2. Prototypes of several devices were built and tested to fulfill requests from multinational  corporations;  3. Further proof-of-concept validation studies could be conducted advancing the commercial  viability of several diagnostic too4. Hundreds of thousands of follow- on funding from the NSF and NIH were received to continue developing TAF products for commercialization.   Metrics: Commercialization success at SUNY can be measured by the business community\u2122s access to  three critical resources which are abundant at SUNY:  the people, technology and infrastructure that comprise the SUNY innovation ecosystem.  Therefor e, our metrics should capture how these three key assets are being leveraged impact the regional  economy.  Bringing products and services based on  academic research to the market requires significant  upfront investment.  The pr obability of recouping that  initial investment in revenue is ex tremely small.  Solely measuring commercializati on activity quantitatively  is not an effective way of showing how the TAF program is successful  at growing New York\u2122s economy.  Using the TAF-funded technologies, SUNY will endeavor to adopt and utilize new metrics that will show the real-world impacts SUNY-developed technologies hav e on society. These metrics are identified below:   Number of licenses executed;   Stories identifying real-world impact TAF-funded technologi es provide;   The number of people positively affected by the use of X, Y, Z SUNY TAF-funded  technology;   The number of startup companies created around commercializing a SUNY TAF-funded  technology;   The number of new jobs created related to the commercialization of SUNY TAF-funded technology;   The number of collateral relationships generated (materials transfers, inter-institutional);   Number of TAF proposals which have advanc ed a technology at least one level of  technology readiness;   Number of students participating/engaged in TAF project teams;   Number of pre-seed investments made to a  company that licensed a SUNY TAF-funded  technology;   Number of companies securing SUNY incubator space that licensed a TAF-funded technology;   Number of companies that licensed TAF-funded technologies and secured private investment; and  The research volume received in  relation to TAF-funded technologies.   It is imperative to shift the metrics  paradigm to better show how the work of SUNY researchers is making positive societal impacts.  In addition  to the quantitative metrics that t he RF captures, the RF will also  undertake significant effort to promote stories that clearly identify the real-world outcomes that TAF will facilitate utilizing the metrics above as well as  APLU\u2122s CICEP Measures of  Economic Contributions.

aV     APLU CICEP Case Study 2 Regionalization of Innovation Operations   In alignment with SUNY\u2122s Strategic Plan The Power of SUNY to build the Entrepreneurial Century and to assist SUNY campuses achieve greater economic impacts based on their research and activities, the Research Foundation for The State University of Ne w York (RF) implemented the regionalization of the innovation operations in July, 2011.  Before regionalization, SUNY had four technology transfer offices at   university centers which served only their own locations, and one technology transfer office at RF Central  Office which served 27 campus locations.  SUNY t oday has seven innovation offices; five regional  innovation hubs located at Albany, Binghamton, Buffalo, the Co llege of Nanoscale Science and Engineering, and Stony Brook, which provide innovation services to other SUNY campuses in their regions, while Downstate Medical Center and  Upstate Medical University each have technology transfer offices on their campuses which provide services only on site.     Each of SUNY\u2122s Regional Innovation Hubs leads the effort in their respective regions of the state for  technology transfer and commercialization support services, and collaborate with business startup, incubation, entrepreneurship, and economic development programs.  Privat e sector investors and venture capital organizations are currently linked to SUNY campuses and faculty largely through local networks and  campus-led innovation and commercialization structures.  SUNY lever ages its strengths and competency across the entirety of the SUNY syst em through its established hub model, which offers commercialization centers across New York in Downstate/Long Island, the Capital Region/ North Country, the Southern Tier /Central New York, and Western New York.  Each hub provides innovation and entrepreneurship support services to its partner campuses \u0152 the SUNY comprehensive and agricultural and technology colleges in each region.  Many of SUNY\u2122s business schools provide entrepreneurship and management training  programs to assist startups.  Together, these provide skill an d knowledge enhancement for the human  capital needed to turn technology and intellectual property into viable and sustainable businesses.
p1647
aV The RF supports this model by providing severa l system-wide resources including legal, information  services, and other support to the campus-based hubs and  tech transfer offices; an assistant director to assist the hubs to engage, educate, and \ufb01mine\ufb02 disclosures from  the partner campuses reporting disclosures into the hubs; Inteum,  a robust intellectual property management software solution, for all  commercialization offices throughout the system; an innov ation website to form a virtual bridge between SUNY faculty, SUNY innovation staff, and  the business community; co-branding of the University-Industry  Demonstration Partnership\u2122s Researcher Guidebook: A Guide for Successful Institutional-Industrial  Collaborations which contains best practices to promote strategic deal-making when collaborating with industry; SUNY\u2122s Technology Accelerator Fund which provides a means to assist the SUNY community by providing funding for select technologies to accelerate their development and commercialization to benefit the public; access to the  Association of University Technology Managers suite of intellectual property educational information; and SUNY Insure provides low-cost insurance to NYS startups formed around SUNY technologies through the RF\u2122s alliance with Amsure Associates.

aVSUNY\u2122s strategic plan The Power of SUNY  demonstrates a clear vision and commitment for contributing to  economic growth based on knowledge and innovation.  Across the country, it has been the public university  that sets the standard for aggressive interaction with industry, experimentation with innovative models for technology transfer and commercialization, and overall unapologetic commitment to economic  development.     The regional innovation model allows SUNY to generate  benefits across the state, while still interacting with  entrepreneurs, idea champions, and funding networks on a local level.  The regionalized model maximizes   SUNY\u2122s collective resources while enabling local interaction and outstanding service to SUNY faculty and  the business community.   See the map of SUNY\u2122s Regional Commercialization Hubs below.

aV  APLU CICEP Case Study 3  HocusLocus, LLC., the University at Albany and th e College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering   In partnership with the University at Albany, HocusLocus, LLC. developed a trans-RNA switching  mechanism called structurally interacting RNA or \ufb01sxRNA\ufb02 that uses unique microRNA expression profiles  to express desired proteins in a cell specific manner .  sxRNA technology enables targeted expression of any chosen protein in cells of specific tissues, disease states, and developmental stages by coupling post-transcriptional regulation processes with unique microRNA signatures.   The ability to target and control  expression of a protein in-vivo using RNA, rather than DNA, opens up new possibilities for molecular tools, therapeutics, vaccines, and imaging applications.   Stem cells have enormous scientific and therapeutic potential, but are presently hindered by the difficulty of maintaining and ensuring their homogeneity in culture either in an undifferentiated state or as a uniform, definable, differentiated population.  sxRNA could be used to negatively cull out differentiated cells while allowing undifferentiated cells to conti nue growing, or vice versa.  Likewise, the ability to positively select for specific miRNA expressing cells would be valuable for directing stem cell differentiation to homogeneity. The market for stem cells was $21.5 billion in 2010 and is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 24%.  Research tools supplied to this market is expected to reach $1.4 billion in size in 2013.  There  currently is no product on the market that allows for quality control at the cellular level.  This innovative approach for harnessing the power of  gene expression has the potential to rival the expanding miRNA/siRNA/shRNA fields.  While ther e are numerous methods to quantify miRNAs in vitro, quantifying miRNAs in vivo  is difficult and tedious. We believe that our sxRNA based kits would be unique in the marketplace.    Beyond molecular tools, there are over 900 conditions resulting from the improper production of a protein including Cystic Fibrosis, Niemann-Pick disease, and  Spinal Muscular Atrophy.  sxRNA offers a way to target select cell types for corrected expression of proteins that are lacking.  In addition to genetic disorders, many types of cancer have already been shown to have unique miRNA expression profiles.  In  some cases, miRNAs typically only expressed in em bryonic cells are also expressed in metastasizing  cancer cells, for example miR-373 and miR-520c.  sxRNA could be used to target these cells with a death-gene, killing cancer cells selectively.    The sxRNA mechanism as a naturally occurring post-tr anscriptional regulatory mechanism was originally identified by Dr. Scott Tenenbaum and his lab at the State University of New York University at Albany College of Nanoscale Sciences and Engineering.   The Tenenbaum lab has pioneered methods for immunoprecipitating RBP-RNA complexes and receiv ed a $2.5MM NIH grant as part of the Human Genome Project to study RBP activity.  While studying the potential for miRNA/RBP cross-talk, the Tenenbaum lab identified several naturally occurring miRNAs that appear to stabilize or disrupt RBP binding sites using sxRNA principles.  The ability to rationally design sxRNA switches to control RBP   binding was patented by the University at Albany and exclusively licensed by HocusLocus, LLC.

aVHocusLocus has received a Phase I STTR from the National Institutes of Health to develop molecular tool applications using sxRNA and received an invest ment from the Eastern New York Angels.   The President of HocusLocus, LLC., Ted Eveleth,  began his relationship with Dr. Scott Tenenbaum and SUNY in 2008 when he was asked to be the business lead on a team  of individuals evaluating the  commercialization potential of University Albany technology during a Pre-Seed Workshop.  Initially skeptical  of the commercial potential, over  the 2  day workshop, Ted became more enthusiastic of the technology and stayed in contact with Dr. Scott Tenenbaum, the inventor and now CNSE faculty member.  U Albany filed patent applications and provided funding to furt her support the development of the technology.  Then  Ted was recruited as the first Technology Entrepreneur in Residence in the Albany Small Business  Development Center.  In that capacity he began providing one-on-one consulting and advice to Dr.  Tenenbaum, which eventually led to Ted forming HocusLocus LLC. and licensing the technology into the company.  The combination of Dr. Tenenbaum research and Ted\u2122s business savvy led to HocusLocus   successfully receiving very competitive, STTR funding from the federal government, Dr. Tenenbaum receiving 2 rounds of SUNY TAF funding to support further research and development, and most recently led to HocusLocus receiving an investment from a local angel investment community.  This is all to support the development and commercialization of a technology dev eloped by at the University at Albany.  None of this would have ever been realized if it was not for the partnership the University at Albany created with Ted Eveleth.

p1656
aVTexas Tech University (TTU)   conducted an extensive institutional assessment by engaging  our internal and external stakeholders, as well as assembling indicators of our innovation and  outre ach efforts and effectiveness.  The  intens ive   self - assessment   fostered a  deeper  commitment  to in novation, outr each, and economic development;  verified   o ur effectiveness and  goals ; and   deepened   community involvement.   Economic prosperity is a function of internationalization, innovation, and institutions  working collaboratively toward economic growth, sustainable infrastructure,  mutually beneficial   partnerships, and resource developmen t 1 .   Our  institutional leadership  in terpreted   as  the creation of new knowledge or solutions to existing challenges and unanticipated needs that  positively impact the economy and society.   This positive impact translates into local, regional,  national, and global improvement in se rvices,   commodities, technology, infra structure, and  quality of life.   Local and regional collaborations provide a means to foster econo mic prosperity  and innovations.   The institution   is on the precipice of a transformation from a regional employer  and economic developer to a formidable resource for innovation and prosperity in a global  economy.

aV   The IEP experience encouraged an in -  weakness es, as well as the foresight to plan for future economic engagement.  In defining   e discovered a rich depth of current economic  engagement  activities led by faculty, students, and small busines s development centers .  The  following strengths, university - industry - government relationships, student engagement, and the  Small Business Development Center,   will be  leveraged   to i mprove   our identified areas of  growth:   communication, strategy, and leadership.   1.2   Process Experience
p1659
aVWe began this process by assembling a core team   that   regularly briefed and guided an  executive advisory board  consisting of university, community, and business economic  development leaders.  The  core   team  analyzed and modified   the CICEP Assessment Tools . These  tools included external and internal surveys that were adapted to better accommodate our  stakeholders:   business and community leaders, faculty and staff, current students , department  leadership,   and alumni .   In partnership with the Lubbock Chamber  of Commerce 2 , the Lubbock  Economic Development  Alliance 3 , and the Lubbock City Council 4 , we administered the  online  survey 5   to area business and community leaders .   These   external partners   sent   a n electronic  invitation from  our  President   and   V ice  P re sid ent for  R esearch   to their membership lists .   T his  invitation   was also sent internally   to all faculty and senior staff.
p1660

p1661
aV   The   core team   also  modified the CICEP Metrics   to make them more applicable to our  institution.  Our metrics defined an institution that ha s made vast strides in the las t three years,  and our  success is measurable on a number of fronts.   This baseline data will be the tool to  measure our economic prosperity efforts.  In addition to  the Assessment  Tools and Metrics ,  the  core team   surveyed   our current students and alumni. F or  current students ,  we partnered with the  Student Government Association  to add a   short survey to the  election ballot.  W e  also  worked  with the Texas Tech Alumni Associat ion   to gauge  the opinions of our former students .     The executive advisory board   reviewed the results and  developed themes and a data  summary for  internal and external stakeholder  forums .   Both forums open ed   dialogue  that  resulted in   a list of act ion items.   The   detailed  action items  were incorporated into  our strategic  planning .   Forming our   summary,  results revealed a consistent trend of  stakeholders   rating our  priority of economic engagement higher than our performance. T he internal audience was more  concerned   about process 6 , while  the external   group  focus ed on results and   deliverables 7 .  Results  also revealed  common   prio rities of improved two - way communication   and mutual strategic  planning  to foster sustainable economic develop ment and   innovati ve partnerships .   The IEP process uncovered partners and issues that were not originally considered as  traditional economic engagement. One example includes the leadership of South Plains Mall  describing their location as the perfect test bed for commercialization and econo mic success.   Student entrepreneurs already use this location to test the economic feasibility of their products.
p1662
aV   Furthermore, a n economic engagement emphasis positively affects the   mission  of   learning, discovery and engagement.  Essentially, this focus causes our faculty to  approach their curriculum with more of an innovative charge and with a specific outcome. This  emphasis promotes not only the knowledge gained through a course, but also an application  piece that takes the lesso ns learned one step further. We hope this mindset will challenge our  faculty to teach our students how to be more entrepreneurial and take what they are learning in  the classroom into the real world.     1.3   The Economic Engagement Enterprise
p1663
aVThe institution   c ontinues to grow its public - private part nerships, involving government,   business ,   and community partners.  Examples include Bayer CropScience, the Nation al Wind   relationship with Sandia National Laboratory and industry partners, the East Lubb ock  Promise Neighborhood   Cooperative Research Center, involving several industry members.    The  institutional   leadership defines   economic engagement as the mutual exchange of  knowledge an d resources between  TTU   and our public and private stakeholders to promote  economic security, educational opportunities ,   and cultural activity in the city, region ,   and state  by transferring research discoveries into marketable products  a nd services; sharin g technical  expertise and equipment; and providing educational opportunities and workforce development 8 .
p1664
aV8   Modified from the Carnegie Foundation Community Engagement definition and the Rockefeller Institute of  Government, State University of New York at Albany .   
p1665
aV   Though  there is  a  shared vision by our internal and external  partners ,  our definition resonates  differently with each group . The internal  group   focuses their economic engagement efforts on  educational opportunities and workforce development. The external  group   places more of a  priority on economic security, cultural activity, and discoveries of marketable products and  services.  By partnering toge ther, we can achieve   the shared vision of economic prosperity .    The   s   commercialization and innovation   efforts   have been disjointed in the past  with small pockets of individual researchers attempting to take their products to market;  however,   t he IEP process has  better define d and focused these efforts, as well as provide d   a  better understanding of  faculty  need s . The  institution   is building a Research Park facility that  will include an incubator and an  accelerator for faculty and  student entrepr eneurs.  A lso, the   new  Director of Translational Research and  Entrepreneurialism   will  be instrumental in establishing  programs that provide scientific  and technical support for   new public - private partnerships   and  support the expansion of a knowledge - based  economy .  Further, the IEP process  also uncovered  the fact that many faculty  researchers  are unaware of   the   available commercialization  resources  available. Working with the Office of  Technology  Commercialization, the Vice President for  Research will create   communications that help faculty understand the process and resources  available to them.     Based on our definition, we identified consistent  strength s , specifically the mutual respect  and interest shared by  the institution , community leaders,  and  regional  business es.   Further, the  institution continues to  buil d   relationships with industry an d government partners, involve   students in entrepreneur ial activities, and facilitate   small business development.  These results  
p1666
aV   parallel our definition   in that   our  students are engaged in community organizations and involve d   in entrepreneurial endeavors. Likewise, o ur a lumni reported that they were well prepared for  the  workforce , had high perce ptions of TTU academics, and possessed   strong loyalty to   the  institution .   The strong response to our data collection and stakeholder  forums   clearly revealed an  existing   foundation of elements necessary for highly successful strategic economic development  and innovation   partnerships.   In each forum, participants repeatedly noted  the positive  improvement and change that had been occur ring over the last three years.   From the  administration to individual centers and faculty, the community and external stakeholders noted  the significant ga in in commitment and momentum.  While it is cle ar that the journey to  economic prosperity entails time, full commitment, and a culture change, these challenges,  though difficult, will require strong leadership and a clear action plan.   A s a stepping - stone to heighten our activity and create sustainab le,   unprecedented  partnerships ,  institutional   leadership has committed to several areas of growth and improvement.  First is the  commitment to standing, periodic discussion forums cente red on topics of mutual  interest to both internal  and external  stakeholders, t he first of  which   took place a few weeks prior  to  submission.   We will continue to expand our communication strategies, internally and  externally.     Second,  institutional  leadership is  also  committed to creating a strategic economic  developmen t plan, streamlining commercialization processes, establishing the framework for a  campus culture shift, and developin g and increasing trust relation ships with external  
p1667
aV   stakeholders.  One strategy for increasing economic development relationships is the ins  recent connection to the Center for Innovation (CFI) 9 . CFI focuses   on the commercialization of  technology - based research outcomes from universities, industries and U.S. federal labs, leading  to the evolutionary development of integrated industry   clusters.   In addition, the  IEP  process  reinforced the need to continue our quantita tive assessment of our projects and   pa rtnerships.   The  data has become a tool for mutual reflection and discussion with our partners, further deepening  our level of commitme nt and strategic sharing.   1.4   Economic Engagement Planning
p1668
aVMoving forward, the institution will build upon its strengths by capitalizing   on  current   partnerships  and replicating these best practices with potential partners . We will encourage our  students to be the catalysts for a culture shift towards increasing economic engagement,  embracing both strategy and leadership. Finally, we will incorporate the practices of the small  business development  programs  to  inform faculty , students, and administrators on how to engage  with industry.   Our   institutional  leadership recognizes that a culture change is necessary  and  is already  moving to implement changes and plans to promote economic engagement .  One   way  to achieve  this  culture c hange is  to include  patents and innovation  i n the promotion and tenure dossier .   Another resource is  utilizing the   Director of Translational Research and E ntrepreneurism   as   the  point of contact for both external and internal stakeholders   and leading the imp lementation of
p1669
aV   entrepreneurial programs.   In correlation with this role, the Office of the Vice President for  Research (OVPR)   plan s   to  write   a   guide   for   translational re search.
p1670
aV  to regional cities  for the  VPR begin econo mic development conversations.  Additionally, t he  Vice President for  Research in coordination with the President will  continue to  host  regular  community luncheons .  These meetings will include diverse audiences inte rested in economic development activities and  future collaborations.   The examples shared ab ove demonstrate our institutional   commitment to  allocating resources to this effort.    1.5  Promotion and  Communication     As  a result of the IEP process, we   are already experiencing   higher levels of successful  communication with both internal and external stakeholders.   The  institution  identified major  stakeholders in the community and region as those involved with the Lubbock Economic  Development Alliance (LE DA), the Lubbock Chamber of Commerce, regional economic  development officials, city and county elected officials, area school district trustee s and  administrators , as well as  area business   leaders .    As we moved through the IEP designation process, one  recurring stakeholder   observation   was the need for consistent, genuine, and  strategic mutual communication.   Internal stakeholders  want the administration to create a strategic economic development plan, communicate the plan,  and prov ide guidance on its exe cution. Further, they have the   desire to engage more in economic  development activities but lack the to ols and resources to initiate. Our e xternal stakeholders   want  results and view communication as necessary to forge partnerships.     
p1671
aV   The institution has  clearly made surface attempts   to brief the community, but has   not  effectively engaged in interactive and participatory discussion based on mutua l respect and  interest.   Current communications include: news releases on new technology and/or new  partnerships;   biannual economic impact studies; an annual Stat e of the System Address by the  C hancellor  and the President   the  community; an annual  report from the Office of Technology Commercialization; and economic engagement stori es in  Discoveries 10  ; and  regular integrated addresses by the  President to various interest groups within the com munity, region, and state .   The IEP  discovery process  provided a platform to discuss  the type of  communication and  collaboration needed to further partner ships   and develop   more substantive, sustainable economic  growth and innovation .   Some  additional  communication vehicles have been deployed, and  include: regular publication in the  Scholarly Messenger 11  - newsletter;  social media; an economic engagement website 12 ; and standing collaborative workshops,  luncheons, and panels .   The OVPR also will work with the  Lubbock  Chamber of Commerce and  LEDA to develop appropriate external communicati on vehicles. The soon - to - be formed student - led organization,   Texas Tech Innovation, Mentorship, and Entrepreneurialism   (TTIME), will  educate and mentor students  interested in translating their innovations into the marketplace.   In  addition to the  Texas Tech   Alumni Association , each college as well as administrators have  committed to communicating to our alumni base through technology and in - person contact.

p1673
aV   Finally , o ur discovery process led to the establishment of regular  internal and external  communications   through  co mmunity   luncheons , economic development tours, and weekly  discussion series .  Our inaugural  community  luncheon provided a briefing on k ey applied  research initiatives   and invited discussion, feedback, and idea  exchange .  The effort  was  well  receiv ed, and  future  luncheons will target areas of mutual interest   including :  agriculture;  oil and  gas impacts , wind engineering, water issues, food safety, and large data computi ng.     Our discovery process  led to  another new avenue for external communication,  an ide a  proposed by the CEO of LEDA   who   encouraged  the   VPR to accompany him on a tour to visit  with   regional economic development entities, city council  members, and business leaders.  The  tours  will  foster collaborations and develop partnerships among TTU, Lubbock and other cities  in the region.  Further, t  nother   new aven ue for internal communication.  This series highlights commercializatio n and  engagement topics for   faculty, staff, and students.    1.6  Advancing University Economic Engagement     The institution   strives to be a leader   in economic engagement. Through the discovery of our  strengths and challenges, steps have been  initiated  to capi talize on our assets and build  o n  new  priorities.  Through  partnering with our external community ,   the institution is  equipped to  lead  the  emphasis on translational research and innovative collaborations  in the region.   Throughout the IEP process, we had  direct, collaborative communication with those engaged  in our discovery process. T he institution reached out to  CICEP - designated institutional mentors  seeking their   advice on how best to engage external stakeholders .  The most astute advice was the  
p1674
aV   encourag ement to not be prescriptive in our  communications with our external stakeholders but  to allow for candid, open communication at the forum.  We  shared our communications plan,  proposed strategies, and our survey results with the CICEP community. We also sha red our  modified survey tools with CICEP leadership.    Our success in creating a large - scale collaborative platform could be translated into best  practices for other institutions seeking to improve economic engagement.   If awarded the IEP  University D esignation ,   we would be willing to serve as a mentor for f uture designation cohorts.  Our P resident has joined the CICEP executive committee and agreed to serve on a CICEP panel  to discuss the IEP process at the annual summer meeting.  To further disseminate   best practices,  w e will continue to build on the materials available on our IEP website.

aV   Part 2:  Summary of Accomplishments     (Word count: 1440 /2000)   2.1 Area One :   University - Industry - Government Relationship     The institution   plays  an ever - increasing role as  the  drive r   and agent  of economic change in  the triple - helix of the university - industry - government relationship , as evidenced by   f our  successful initiatives.   A   $27 million gi ft   to TTU   from Bayer Crop Science 13   will be   matched  dollar - for - dollar by the Texas Research Incentive Program (TRIP) 14 , resulting in $54 million  of  total funding .  Similar pursuits   are emerging throughout academia today, as major corporations  ( particularly   life - science enterprises ,   such as the pharma ceutical, biomedical, and agribusiness  sectors) strive to keep basic  and applied  research at universities on track to sustain the  knowledge - based economy on which their private ventures depend.   The institution   is  also  an innovator  in the realm of wind scie nce, engineering ,   and energy.   I nterdisciplinary, educational ,   and research   opportunities have long been central to  our   approach  to studying wind.  The   National Wind Institute (NWI) 15 ,   along with   representatives from the  Department of   Energy, Sandia National  Laboratories 16 , Vestas 17   and Group NIRE 18 ,  commissioned the Scaled   Wind Farm Technology (SWiFT) facility   at  the   Reese Technology

p1681
aVT he single largest asset that a major institution  can bring to the economic dev elopment and  innovation table is  our students.   S tudents translate their  education into relevant and applied skills  for the workplace while remaining connected to the  institution .   Our   students are engaged,  interested, and eager to participate in community outreach, including econom ic development and  innovation.  On the spring Studen t Government Association ballot   we included engagement  and  innovation  questions 22 .  Of the 6017 respondents ,   4589 are engaged   in community organizations,  1073 are engaged in inventing or entrepreneurship , and  4014 expressed interest  in  becoming  involved .   M any students  are  already   successful   in   developing new ideas and marketing their ideas to  external   companies and industry.  For example, two  students founded  EasyLaunch 23 ,   which is a  cell phone application that provides ea sy picture and color - coding to help any person navigate all   se   students have pres ented their technology

Another example i s t he students responsible for inventing  Glow Station  LLC 24 ,   which   is a technology startup company with a line of  washable  sportswear designed to  illuminate to sound.  The students have appeared at trade shows, conferences, showcases, and  festivals, and the  shirts  have been marketed well to the sports and entertainment industries. Both  groups of students continue to develop new products and also venture out into new industries.    Our  expanding   array of applied degrees and cer tifications further demonstrate   our  institutional commit ment to sustaining this asset.  The institution   has 44 certificate programs, and  is creating additional certifications in the area s   of engineering,  cybersecurity , nutrition, financial  planning, restaurant and hotel management, food  safety, agriculture, and public administration.  F ac ulty members are committed to curricula that prepare   students for a global society , teach the  skills and tools necessary for success ful   pa rticipation in a global society, and recognize   the  importance of co mmunity   participation and engagement.  Many of the degree prog rams offer  study abroad opportunities , and we have several that require international practicums and  internships for graduation.   In 2013, 921 of our  students studied abroad   and 1128 were involved   in domestic internships and practicums.     Furthermore, our  alumni survey demonstrated that  student s   graduate to become successful,  loyal, engaged professionals interested in a continued relationship locally, regionally, n ationally,

Of  the 1426 alumni initially responding to our survey, 1350 indicated that  the institution   prepared them well for their career   and  1236 rated their loyalty  as more than   837 indicate d   the highest level of loyalty 25 .   Recently, t h e Wall Stre et  Journal listed Texas Tech University   as 18 th   in the country for preparing students for the  workforce 26 .  As degree programs continue to in tegrate learning with industry , our students will  become prepared, successful and engaged alumni.   2.3 Area Three :  Small Business Development    The  North w est Texas Small Business Development Center ( NWT   SBDC ) 27   is  a Texas Tech  operated   small business resource.

aV   Part 3:  Growth/Improvement Plan   (Word count: 1347 /2000)   3.1 Area One :  Communication     The institution   has discussed its role in economic engagement over the years, but never has  there been this level of commitment by top administration to involve the faculty and reach out to  the community. Communication efforts  in the past have been limited, but t he IEP p rocess  helped  us   define  more focused, deliberate, and strategic communication needs both internally and  externally. We utilized the IEP surveys and forums to help us addre ss concerns and   needs and  to  begin to develop  solutions.  S ensitive to the need t o rea ch out to the community,   we  ask ed   for  input early.    M ajor barriers to  increased   economic engagement  include   a lack of conversation and  understandin g, internally and externally, of   existing needs  and  how the   institution  seeks solutions   to   address those needs.   Both internal and external partners have expresse d the desire to  collaborate,  increase the economic development of the r egion and the state, and  learn how to  accomplish that goal. Communication was cited   as a key need by both groups.  As a first response  to the need for communication, we posted all of the results from our four surveys 32 .  This website  will be expanded to provide  information  on commercializing   products and  connecting with  external  partners. The website will also highlight  successful innovators and innovativ e research,  as well as provide   a forum for further communication.

aV   The President and VPR have begun a series of community luncheons involving members of  the Lubbock b usiness community and faculty.  These luncheons provide f ace - to - face  communication and will be organized around topics of regional importance, such as water  conservation, oil and gas, sustainable agriculture and wind energy.   We will help faculty learn  how to  discuss their research with industry and how to determ ine the market ap plicability of their  research.  Business and community  leaders  have been given an in depth look at  our   research and  had the opportunity to voice the ir needs , an opportunity that will continue into the future.   Taking the community luncheon s    economic development leaders, will begin a tour of regional cities to meet with elec ted officials,  business  and economic development leaders, to gain a better understanding of the   and how Te xas Tech can play a role in meeting those needs. The   initial cooperation between the  institution  and business  and community  leaders has opened a door to developing a new level of  trust and communication, bringing all parties to the table to talk log ically  about area needs and  institutional  resources. New internal communication vehicles will include the web, social media,  and existing inter nal newsletters. Externally, the institution   will work with  economic  development,  business ,   and  community  leaders  to est ablish efficient and practical  communication methods based on needs. Success will be measured by new partnerships formed,  new avenues of communication opened, and stronger trust between the region and the institution.   3.2 Area Two :    Strategy     The institution  will   harness  the wealth of expertise, energy,   and resources , both internal ly   and  external ly ,   and will motivate the coordination of a   strategic and choreographed economic  
p1704
aV   development plan.  Institutional   leadership will coordinate an economic   development committee  to design and implement this intentional ,   applied strategy. The committee will include members  from the Lubbock Economic Development Alliance (LEDA), the  Lubbock  Chamber of  Commerce and other external stakeholders, as well internal   l eadership. Additionally, f aculty and  administrator buy - in ,   as well as the support of the external community ,   is vital to the execution  of this strategic action plan. Constant and intentional communication is key to the success of this  initiative; therefore , the committee will meet regularly, communicate developments as they  occur, and request feedback from both internal and external  stakeholders .     In order to gain faculty and administrator buy - in regarding economic engagement activities,  the process of comm ercialization and entrepreneurialism will be streamlined to ensure it is free  of burdens. This is achievable through the collaborative efforts of the Office of the Vice  President for Research and the Office of Technology Commercialization, where techn ology   transfer is facilitated.  These tw o offices will work together with  faculty  to define the  areas of  their research  that  could evolve  into  commercialization applications.  These offices will also  assist faculty throughout the commercialization process.   A cult ure change is necessary for  the institution   to be successful in  entrepreneurial  endeavor s .  Institutional  leadership must foster intentionally prepared minds that will  embrace   the  culture of economic engagement.   Changing the culture requires on - going  discussions about  economic engagement through multiple mediums, as well as a co ncerted effort on many fronts.  One strategy for culture change is the utilization of a current   digital tracking system to include a  section for patents, licenses, start - up busin esses, and other commercialization activit ies.  A  
p1705
aV   required resource for   a successful culture change is   an emphasis on commercialization in  addition to the tenets of teaching, research, and  service .   A n  area of  untapped economic engagement opportunity   is   the  number of highly innovative   research centers and clusters that  the institution   has  developed   in the last few years.  Armed with  high levels of faculty expertise and equipped with state - of - the - art resources, methods, tools, and  techniques, these centers offe r promise for collaborative problem solving to address issues of  local, r egional, and national concern. These centers, in coordination with regional business and  community leaders, can be the catalysts of innovative growth through  strategic economic  dev elo pment processes.  Institutional   leadership must engage these centers and foster  entrepreneurial activities.   Another strategic endeavor involves d evelop ing   trust with external organizations .  Considering   the  transition of institutional leadership , it will tak e time to develop trust  relationships with the external community.  As   outreach continues  and  actions  follow ,   relationships   and communications   will become more  beneficial and  candid , resulting in   a shared  vision of   economic engagement .     3.3 Area Three :   Leadership     Institutional   leadership will orchestrate community outreach and economic development by  providing requested resources to both internal and external communities. The IEP discovery   process uncovered  an undeniable  need to have a single, designate d administrator that would lead  all strategic economic development, outreach, and innovation i nitiatives for the institution.  While  we had numerous pockets of successful research, partnership, and collaboration,  the  
p1706
aV   decentralized reality limited ou r  ability to leverage resources and   develop a coordinated strategic  plan.
p1707
aV  The institutional   leadership has responded by creating a new position within the Office of the  Vice President for Research, the Director of Translational Research   and Entrepreneuria lism  (DTRE).   In addition to serving as the point - of - contact for the external community, this  individual will establish and manage programs that support the expansion of our knowledge - based economy.   This includes   programs that provide scientific and technic al   support to the  business sector   and programs that  translate our research into startup companies .  It  is important  that the  DTRE   maintains  lines of communication  between external and internal partners .
p1708
aVThe internal community requested assistance in en gag ing with external partners.  The process  of commercialization is often difficult for inex perienced faculty .  In response, institutional  leadership will develop a G uide to Translational Research.  This guide will allow faculty to have  a more step - by - step appro ach to commercialization and allow external partners to understand  how their institution al partners are progressing .  Further, faculty consistently mentioned that  translational research has been communicated as a priority, but the promotion  and tenure  appli cation does not reflect this . Therefore, a section will be added for patents  and licenses  on the  promotion and  tenure dossier.  Also, the leadership will wor k  to streamline processes to ease the  burden on faculty.

aVOn the spring Student Government  Association ballot, we included a question that asked  students if they are interested in campus entrepreneur ial   re sources.  Of the 6017 respondents,  4014 said they were very interested, but very few indicated that they were currentl y engaged in  
p1710
aV   such an acti vity.  This fall, we are launching TTIME, which stands for Texas Tech Innovation,  Mentorship and Entrepreneurship .  Through this  student - led organization , students will form  interdisciplinary teams aimed at actual commercialization of university - generated in novations   with close support from their faculty mentors . They will, along the way, learn  how to   develop  technical prototypes, build a collaborative business plan, and  raise operating capital.   We  encourage our recent graduates to lead these new businesses t hat translate research developments  into viable market products and services.   Overall, we believe the institution   has created a  dynamic, entrepreneurial culture that supports our efforts to become an IEP designated  university.

The VPR and  Lubbock Economic  Development officials will  visit regional cities to  meet with city/county  elected officials, economic  directors and business  leaders to bett er  understand the needs of  the small towns and cities  that make up the South  Plains region.   The luncheons  have already begun  with an overview  of TTU research  for key elected and  economic  development  officials, business  leaders and the  institution  president   and vice  president for  research. The  result was a better  understanding of  major TTU  research initiatives  and a discussion of  how these leaders  see the institution  better addressing  community needs.  A tour of regional  cities and town  will begin by  Septembe r 2014.   Resources have  included a core  IEP committee  to plan these  luncheons and  begin planning  the regional  tour. The  Lubbock  Economic  Development  Alliance CEO  and the  Chamber of  Commerce  president have  been active  contributors to  the process  offering sup port,  ideas and  communication  with their  stakeholders.  Funding will  include  providing  lunches and  travel.   Success will be  shown with  better  communication  and  understanding  between the  region and the  institution. So  far indicators are  positive by way  of ane cdotal  conversations  and expressions  of appreciation  for the   efforts.  Ultimately,  success will be  measured in new  partnerships and  involvement by  the community  in university  economic  development  efforts.     Objective 1.2  Communication  Vehicles

aV   This objective is already  underway. A person has  been hired for this  position, and her first day  is May 19, 2014. In order  to establish her as the  point of contact, we need  to promote awareness and  get her connected with our  community leadership and  local and regional industry  current and potential  partners.   The target timeline  for her to be in  place is within the  next month. We  hope to build her  con tacts and the   awareness over the  next six months.   As this is a  constant endeavor,  she will continue  to make  connections and  partnerships  throughout.   Resources have  been allocated to  support her  salary and  benefits. There  are also student  assis tants to  support her role.  Facility needs  include office  space, and  shared  conference and  meeting rooms.  In the future,  there may be a  need for  additional staff  to help support  her job  functions, and  this will be  analyzed as time  progresses.   One way we wil l  know we have  been successful  is by the amount  of contacts this  person makes  and by  the     awareness in  using her as a  resource. We  hope the  inquiries for her  help and  guidance will  grow and  collaborations  will   increase.     Objective 3.2  Assist fa culty in  navigating the  commercializatio n process .

aV The OVPR has  implemented the idea of  putting together a guide  for faculty in translational  research. This guide will   -  instrument available for  faculty at any time. Of  course, our offic e of  technology  commercialization is  always available for  assistance, but this will be  an additional avenue of  getting resources to our  researchers and faculty.    The target deadline  for this guide is to  have it complete  by August when  school is back in  ses sion.    Current staff is  assigned to work  on this task, so  additional staff  and office space  is not needed.   The  collaboration  between offices  and pulling  together  information will  be how the  majority of time  will be spent.  Further,  promoting this  guide and   letting  faculty know  that this is  available will be  another part of  the process that  will require staff  support and  possibly costs in  printing.   We will know  we have been  successful if  faculty  communicate  that they  understand the  process and are  able to more  easily navigate  how to  commercialize  their inventions.  Another  indicator is if  there is an  increase in the  amount of  commercialized  inventions . The  awareness and  the actual use of  this process will  be our primary  indicators.

This  is the peak time for  students to get  involved in  organizations and  will be a great way  to engage them  early in the  semester.    would need to  commit some of  their time to  helping to  mentor these  students.  Further, some  funds may   be  needed to send  students to  conferences,  help promote  and market their  technologies,  and to bring in  materials based  on the  innovation.    fully able to  analyze our  reach as more  students become  involved and  aware of this  new opportunity.

aV  3.   Growth/Improvement Plan   (Word count: 1187/2000)   Two of three primary areas for improvement were known but validated by the self - study process.  These are 1) the need to strengthen industry/corporate relations and 2) the need to increase  interaction with greater - Phoenix based stakeholders. The third was i lluminated through the self - study process  the need to increase awareness of the innovation, entrepreneurship and economic  contributions of the UA among our stakeholders.     A.   Improved Corporate and Industry Relations     shor t -   and  long - term   competitive and innovation goals.   University - wide, there is an a ggressive   The UA   is a large  university, with many dimensions that drive and can grow industry rel ations.  Three specific  areas are discussed in this application:  1) Developing institutional leadership and resources  to grow win - win partnership programs and approaches; 2) Improve the actual operations  processes related to contracting and administration , easing interactions for outside   - leading Tech Parks to create stronger and more  widespread industry relations. Other major activities beyond these three include the  standing up of new centers (ACABI, WEST, DSRI), wh ich are discussed in other sections of  this application.   a.   Institutional Leadership :  The UA Office of Research and Discovery (ORD) has  created and is recruiting a VP of University Research Business Development.   The position is designed to i dentify, deepen,   and broaden relationships with  external stakeholders based on alignment between faculty interests,  institutional strengths, and of the external partner.   The incumbent will c reate  and maintain   an   effective, colla borative, integrated,  externally focused   organization   that will connect strategic industry and other no n - federal research  partnerships. The VP will c ultivate and  create   new partnerships with external  stakeholders such as industry, small business, NGO s , etc., based on alig nment  among and between  faculty - research interests and those of the external  partner.     b.   Contracting and Administration Operations:    UA has begun and will continue a  major review and re - engineering of its contracting and administrative processes  related to outside  partner  relationships (non - federal) including   organizational  transformation of  contracting   operations to achieve consistency of service,  operational efficiency, and solutions orientation to faculty and staff to enhance  engagement with industry and other non - federa l research sponsors.  Targeted  improvements include reduced contracting time, increased capacity, clarity of  p rocesses and requirements (such as regulatory, export control, publication,  etc.)    -  focus  groups have taken place.     A Sr. Director for Research Partnership Services is  being recruited (new position) to continue assessment, implement  improvements, and  maintain   high standards.

aVc.   Leverage Tech Parks Excellence    best in the  country, housing top companies, a startup incubator, performing technology  testing, experimentation, and demonstration, and engaging in global company  attraction. The Tech Park employs 7,000 people who hold the regions highest  wage average -- $9 1K/year  at   is ideally situated and experienced in creating high value industry partnerships.  To build on these advantages, a second tech park is being developed. The  Bridges Tech Park will serve as the Univ  commercialization activities. The park is under construction with major  infrastructure in place.   A new building to house Tech Launch Arizona and an  innovation center has been approved for funding through a county bond  program  and will begin construction in 2017.     B.   Growth of UA Presence in the Greater - Phoenix Metropolitan Area :   Tucson and Phoenix  are the key metropolitan areas  comprising a  megatropolis , one of five in the U.S.  One  hundred miles away , five times the population of   Tucson, and hosting a  large UA alumni  population,  Phoenix and its related cities (Tempe, Chandler, Scottsdale, etc.) are key targets  for increased presence by the UA and is essential for competitive and economic prosperity  initiatives. Among many college  and discipline - specific outreach activities in the Phoenix  area, UA is targeting three high value areas to increase competitiveness and economic  outcomes through Phoenix relations:     a.   Phoenix Forum :  Host quarterly event in collaboration with prominent  Phoenix - based UA alums, UA Alumni Relations and Tech Launch Arizona.  Forum will focus on  technology sectors of mutual importance to Phoenix and Tucson economies and will  showcase as well as create mechanisms for discussion and collaboration to advance  gro wth opportunities. Coordinators will work with communications teams to share  stories of forum activities and outcomes reaching individuals and companies beyond  attendees.   b.   SBIR/STTR Tech House Phoenix :    Tech Launch Arizona and regional partners have  develop ed Tech House  a regional approach to dramatically increasing SBIR/STTR  awards in the region.  The goal of Tech House is to move Arizona into the top ten  dollar - awarded regions on a per capita basis. This is accomplished through  application of cluster strat egies targeting excellence in SBIR eco - system  rather  than a specific technology sector. The cluster approach has the potential to add  value to all technology sectors, thereby increasing the level of non - dilutive capital to  the region, which in turn increas es the growth capital and entrepreneurial  leadership attracted to the region.  The cluster approach is accomplished through a  vast eco - system approach, spanning small business, research institutions, large  businesses, primes, funding agencies, intermediari es, and other influencers.    and interaction to Phoenix - based small and large business and engage researchers  from Phoenix - based research institutions and labs.  This will inclu de Meetups,  clinics, and one - on - one connections, based on agency solicitations.

aVc.   Expand  Media Presence :  Regardless of any number of other accomplishments to  increase economic opportunities, without the ability to share those stories and  create awareness, w e lose a significant ability to build on them.  Reaching the  Phoenix audience through increased media presence is a major emphasis area for  the UA.  University Relations media staff, TLA, and ORD will work jointly to pitch  stories to Phoenix Media. Univers ity Relations will work with faculty and key  personnel to be available and effective for on - camera interviews and work as  experts in various areas. Approaches include Media Readiness Workshops in UA  colleges and units, hosted by University Relations leader ship.     C.   Increased awareness of innovation, commercialization, and economic development  activities:    As the UA moves aggressively in its super - land grant university mission  a  portion of its success is dependent the degree to which individual successes are we ll known.   To date, good understanding of the Never Settle and TLA goals appear to be well known.  However when asked questions about specifics, fewer survey respondents demonstrated  awareness.  As noted in 2.3  commonplace awareness of innovation and prospe rity  successes are critical to attracting like - minded actors and growing new opportunities.     To increase  awareness   of commercialization activities, TLA and its UA partners will focus on  a range of communications approaches:     a.   Establish a UA News and Arizo na Public Media news category to capture and  produce stories related to innovation competitiveness, and economic prosperity;   b.   Establish an Outreach / Media Calendar, identifying specific stakeholde rs and  aligning messaging goals;   c.   Grow 1Squared Awards, bring ing attention to and celebrating innovation  and  innovation economy leaders;   d.   Redesign TLA website to surface key themes related to how TLA activities and  mission support Never Settle goals and economic development mission. Design  website to engage and conne ct both inte rnal and external stakeholders;   e.

aVU niversity of Arizona APLU   Innovation, Competitiveness, and Economic Prosperity Survey Narrative
p1815
aV In fall, 2014, the University of Arizona APLU leadership group identified internal and  external stakeholder  groups, developed questions, and survey instrument (see separate listings and designation application for  detail) in preparation for the CICEP designation application.  This narrative summary ha s been prepared as a  supplement  to the ap plication materials to communicate how the survey responses were interpreted and  therefore inform UA leadership and stakeholders.   The narrative is broken into four emergent categories:   1.   General perceptions of regional innovation economy, economic growth,  and competitiveness related  to the UA   2.   Open - ended Questions   3.   Moving the Needle    4.   Students, Graduates, and Innovation Workforce
p1816
aVGeneral perceptions of  regional  innovation economy, economic growth, and competitiveness related to  the UA   1.    effectiveness in helping Arizona develop a strong, innovation attracting  economy, more internal stakeholders thought the UA is doing an adequate job than external  stakeholders  however more internal stakeholders also thought the UA is doing an inadequate jo b  than did external stakeholders.  Both were nearly tied in the excellent category, and far more external  stakeholders had no opinion.   2.    were generally in  agreement that it has become more effective or has been generally consistent.   3.     ost important.  A  far lesser percentage considered it to be neither more nor less important than other civic and business  leaders and even fewer thought it was among the least important.   4.
p1817
aVto boost economic development  and regional competitiveness and how well was the university meeting its potential, the vast majority  felt the university does well, but could be doing better. This was followed by a lesser percentage  feeling that the univers ity does live up to its potential.     5.   Considering how well the UA works with industry, government, and others to make Arizona a more  attractive home for innovative companies and people, most thought that the UA is somewhat  effective, followed by fewer belie ving the UA is highly effective.  Approximately 10% feel the UA is not   term outlook for the same kind of collaboration, with slightly more respondents be  future in this area is highly promising, and lesser believing it to be somewhat promising.  Those  believing it is not promising remained at about 6%.     6.    ive  companies and people benefited their own professional field.  Answers were very evenly split between  1) clear positive impact 2) some impact 3) no clear impact 4) no opinion.   Open - ended Questions     survey respondents were asked two open ended questions.  One, to provide three key words to best   Two, respondent s were asked to identify aspects of the UA they feel make the most significant

aV groups, labs, degrees, student groups, etc).   1.   Responses to the three key words questi on were used to generate word clouds based on internal and  external views, and student and non - student views (any other combination or individual stakeholder   of  terms.  The highly used terms included all those we would want to see, including high emphasis on  entrepreneurial, striving, collaboration, energetic, potential, and innovation. Relatively few negative  terms, such as timid, lack - of - motivation, and avera ge, appeared, but warrant consideration.
p1819
aV 2.   The question asking respondents to list programs and groups that are important in the CICEP context   receiv ed single mentions. In an analysis of those programs receiving multiple mentions, it was  interesting and informative to see programs that are viewed very differently by internal than external  stakeholders, and those that are viewed as equally important.  T his informs leadership to explore  whether this is a communications issue, or truly different valuations of the programs.    Moving the Needle    1.   Stakeholders were asked a series of questions regarding the commercialization and innovation trend  related to UA.     research to commercial outcomes and stimulating private industry benef it from its research.   The  trend is CLEARLY positive with emphasis on significant improvement underway. This is a solid  reflection of the turnaround in commercialization and innovation growth commitment of the UA in the  last two years through Never Settle
p1820
aV2.   Consistent with this positive trend, when asked to rate the quality of the entrepreneurial/innovation  ecosystem in Southern Arizona, 73 of 185 respondents feel it has improved in the last two years, but  still needs improvement. 20 feel  it has significantly improved in the last two years. Seven report feeling  it has declined.  37 had no opinion.   3.   External stakeholders were asked to indicate how they expect to interact with the UA (respondents  were invited to select all that applied).  The  top four selected were 1) providing internships or other  experiential learning; 2) Partnership in economic development; and 3) Support in commercializing  technology; 4) Expertise for industry advisory board. These demonstrate a clear trend toward  innovatio n and economic growth related interests.   Students, Graduates, and  Innovation Workforce    1.   With regard to the level of influence of UA grads in making Southern Arizona a place that attracts  innovation, opinions were fairly evenly split between 1) powerful inf luence and 2) some influence.  A  very small number reported that they felt graduates have little or no influence.   2.    opportunities for its graduates, internal and exte rnal populations had very different responses.  Only    3%, while 38   external.   3.   Internal stakeholders who were asked that regardless of their profe ssional interests, if they felt the   generally positive, with 17 of 28 indicating clear or some impact.  Eight responded no clear positive  impact, and three had no  opinion.  External stakeholders were not asked this question.   
p1821
aV4.   Respondents were asked if all, some, select, or no college students should have some kind of  experiential learning experience to help develop innovative and entrepreneurial thinking.   Overwhelmi ngly, respondents agreed that it is essential for all students (94 of 185).  Another 49 felt it  is not essential, but should be broadly available.  Only four felt it is important only to students in select  fields and programs.     5.   Among 19 responding graduat ing students (class of 2015) asked where they expect to start their  career after graduation were evenly distributed among Tucson, elsewhere in Arizona, elsewhere in the  Southwest U.S. and outside the Southwest U.S.  The greatest number (7) indicated unknow n.   6.   Among companies responding to the survey, fewer indicated that UA is a recruiting location for their  company than those who do recruit here.  When companies were asked to characterize the job  readiness of recent UA graduates in work related to science,  technology, and other innovation driving  fields, the vast majority felt these graduates make a positive contribution from the start, or with a  significant learning curve go on to ultimately make a positive contribution.  Only one felt these grads  make litt le or no positive contribution and four had no opinion.  More than half of these responses  were based on expectation or what the respondent had heard, not based on their direct experience as  an employer.   7.   Asking companies and employers to rate the overall p  employment, most thought the grads work is in the top 25%, followed by the lower 50%, the upper  50%, and with only one rating UA grads as among the very best for the duration of their employment.   Nearly two thirds  of these responses were based on expectation or what the respondent had heard,  rather than direct experience as an employer.   8.   External stakeholders asked how they rate working with the UA in recruiting and workforce  development activities had generally neut ral responses.  Three felt it is a positive experience, while  eight felt it was either adequate or needed significant improvement.  Nine had no opinion   9.   Most respondents feel that the best career opportunities for UA graduates exist in the Southwest. This  w as followed by the Lower West Coast.

aV3 1.  Process Narrative  1.1.  Introduction  UCF President Dr. John C. Hitt frequently articulates 1 that our primary mission is to serve Central  Florida (Fig. 1) through activities that achieve economic engagement:   "As we look to the future, it is more evident t han ever that our mission is to boldly serve the needs  of our Central Florida city-state.  It includes partic ipating in our area\u2122s social, cultural, political,  educational, environmental, and intellectual life... we  achieve this end in two ways: 1) by aligning  our teaching, research, and service with the need s of the regional economy, and 2) by being America\u2122s leading partnership university ."     Fig. 1.   The counties comprising Central Florida, th e UCF service region and economic impact area.     Following this charge, our team interprets "innovation"  and "economic prosperity" to be outcomes that all  internal stakeholders strive to achieve through teach ing, research, service, and venture activities that are aligned to meet regional needs, and that are best ach ieved through true partnershi p that mutually benefits  external stakeholders and the institution.   UCF was founded 50 years ago as Florida Technological University 2 to develop workforce and  technology to serve the Space Coast.  UCF has grown, but fostering innovation and economic  development (I&ED) remains the cornerstone of our id entity.  When Dr. Hitt arrived in 1992, his vision  of how the university should economically engage  the region led to his Five Goals for UCF:    1 President John C. Hitt's address to the Florida Board  of Governors on 19 June 2013, Marshall Student Center,  University of South Florida.  2 For additional information on the history of  UCF, please visit http://www.ucf.edu/50.

aV4 1. Offer the best undergraduate education available in Florida  2. Achieve international prominence in ke y programs of graduate study and research 3. Provide international focus to  our curricula and research programs  4. Become more inclusive and diverse  5. Be America\u2122s leading partnership university    The Goals have guided UCF\u2122s enterprises and estab lished the framework for economic engagement in  our strategic plan3.  Striving toward these goals has caused UC F to become a vital force for advancing the  economic prosperity of Central Florida, and more  recently for our growing cadre of national and  international partners.  The annual direct and  added-value economic impact of UCF $19.6 billion. 4   1.2.  Process Experience  UCF's IEPA process consisted of the activities liste d in Table 1 and implemented per the timeline in  Fig. 2.  Our strategy was to be  outward looking .  We view our external stakeholders as  customers and  partners for I&ED who are best positioned to assess its  effectiveness and offer ideas for improvement,  whereas internal stakeholders are best positione d to report how effectively the I&ED mission is  communicated internally.  Objective performance data  shown in Table 2 were obtained by continuing the  CICEP Metrics Study begun in fall 2012.  Perception- of-performance data were collected from internal  and external stakeholders using the Assessment Tools5, one-on-one interviews, and focus groups.  Results  from the Assessments are summarized in Fig. 3.   Key business and community leaders were assembled  for an external-stakeholders focus group (Fig. 4).   This group followed a process illustrated in Fig. 5 to  identify UCF's key strengths and weaknesses in I&ED  (discussed in Sect. 1.3) and to propose potential  improvement ideas.  The IEPA team vetted these and other improvement ideas   guided by key internal  leaders listed in Table 3, and staying mindf ul of economic and institutional constraints   and produced the Improvement Plan presented in Section 3.

Economic Engagement Enterprise  Economic engagement at UCF is defined  in Sect. 1.1 as our primary mission.  It includes all  teaching, research, service, and venture activities that produce innovation and economic prosperity, serve  regional needs, and can best be achieved through true  partnership that mutually benefits the community  and the institution.  This definition is 100% aligned  with definitions offered by Carnegie, Kellogg, and the  American Association of State Colleges and Universiti es.  UCF\u2122s I&ED programs show clearly that both  internal and external stakeholders share this vision.  A great example is the Florida High Tech Corridor  Council (FHTCC) industry-university matching fund program. 6  UCF's economic engagement enterprise  is driven by 12 Colleges and 26 Centers and Institutes  which support 212 degree programs training 59,000 st udents per year.  They produce cutting-edge  research, much co-funded by and supporting local in dustry.  An extensive array of venture services  (Fig. 7 and Case Studies) support technology transfer ; company spin-out, and entrepreneurship.  The  exceptionally successful and nationally  recognized UCF Business Incubator ( UCFBIP) and GrowFL Programs are highlighted in the Case Studies.  Experiential-learning activities involve 21,000 students  annually, producing donations worth $500,000 and 2 10,000 hours of volunteer labor valued at $4.4  million for hundreds of local enterprises.  From  2000 to 2010 Orlando\u2122s college-educated population  increased by 46.6 percent, underscoring UCF phenomenal  impact on the regional economy.  By working  to meet the community\u2122s needs, UCF is able to  provide a desirable, highly skilled workforce.  Identifying and engaging stakeholders  occurs at all levels of the UCF enterprise.  With the second  largest student population in the US and 10,700 faculty  and staff, our internal stakeholders are vast.  Our external stakeholders are our graduates (247,000 an d counting), the citizens of Central Florida, its  companies, corporate leaders, and our regional political  leaders, all of whom are invested in our success.   The response to our Assessments was high and broad across all sub-groups (see footnote #5), which  shows that internal and external stakeholders are strongly engaged with UCF.

(Bottom ) A Medical City for advanced ca re and biomedical research is  now developing around the College of Medicine, which includes a new   Veterans Hospital and a new Nemours Children's Hospital.  example, stakeholders across  Central Florida rallied in support of  the UCF College of Medicine (Fig. 6), founded in 2006.  Support   was so strong that the first class graduated this year debt-free with  full-ride scholarships from local   donors.  The College is the nucleus  for a growing biomedical sciences  and healthcare cluster7 that includes  a new Veterans Hospital and a Nemours Children's Hospital.  This  Medical City is predicted to create   30,000 new jobs with an annual  economic impact of $7.6 billion by  2017. 8  To support economic engagement across the institution   UCF formed in 2012 "Venture  Central", a new umbrella  organization that integrates  entrepreneurship initiatives across   UCF, creating a one-stop shop for  internal and external constituents alike.  This structure, illustrated in  Fig. 7, will "cultivate and support  world-class research  commercialization and economic   growth".  Venture Central will  integrate with and be complemented  by the Coordinated Communications   Council (C3), proposed as part of  Goal 1 in the Improvement Plan.   Strengths and weakness  of UCF's I&ED efforts were clearly identified through the IEPA process  outlined in Sect. 1.2 and are listed in Tables 4 and 5,  respectively.  The Case Studies in Sect. 2 were  selected to profile the top three strengths.  Our Impr ovement Plan in Sect. 3 was designed to address the  top three weaknesses.   7 http://www.cityoforlando.net/elected/mayor/soc04_medical.htm.  8 "UCF: A Metropolitan Research University and Its Ec onomic Impact.

aV15  Table 4.   UCF's top strengths in I&ED , as identified by the external-stakeholders focus group.    Ranked Strengths Summary of comments from participants   1. Venture services UCF venture services (Fig. 7)   including Office of Tech Transfer, the  Business Incubation Program ( UCFBIP ), GrowFL, the Venture Lab, and  related venture/entrepreneurial organization   provide outstanding service  and stimulate tremendous economic growth in Central Florida.    2. Partnerships UCF is distinguished among public institutions by the scope and impact of  its partnerships with the community, particularly those involving research  and workforce development via academic  units, centers, and institutes, and  its active outreach to entrepreneurs an d businesses to promote their growth  by connecting them to resources (e.g.,  research units, UCFBIP, & GrowFL).   3. Research excellence UCF supports numerous,  diverse training and research programs  and diverse talent  in colleges, research  centers and institutes that are nationally and  internationally recognized.  These attr act top students, staff, and faculty  who collectively support regional economic engines, particularly in optics,  aerospace and defense, life sciences  and medical technology, digital  entertainment, and simulation and training.   4. Adaptive culture UCF is able to support rapid program development to meet changing local  needs.  5. Location The climate and amenities in the region are attractive, so people want to  come to Central Florida.   6. Effective leadership UCF leadership has created  an I&ED ecosytem that successfully engages  internal and external stakeholders an d provides the resources needed for  them to work in synergistic partnership that yields economic benefit for the  region.

aV16   Table 5.   UCF's top weaknesses in I&ED, as identifie d by the external-stakeholders focus group.    Ranked Weakness Summary of comments from participants   1. Insufficient funding State support of UCF is too low, but so are financial inputs from  endowments, venture capital, and industrial partnerships.   2. Communication UCF's I&ED services are not  well communicated and seem to duplicate  effort.  We lack a "one-stop shop " for UCF services in outreach and  innovation, which makes it hard to align and connect innovation to  investors.   3. Reputation UCF is known as "big" in student  population, but not neces sarily in quality.  High-quality programs are not well known outside UCF, except to  specialists. This issue is strongly coupled to the weakness in  communication.    4. Rapid growth UCFs growth is  too rapid, unfocused, and outpaces its ability to make and  sustain connections to regional industry and its needs.   5. KSC/UCF integration Both Kenne dy Space Center (KSC) and UCF are undergoing rapid changes,  particularly in mission, and the two or ganizations are not well integrated to  mutually benefit one another as they go through that change.   6. Partnerships are not This creates problems in faculty retention, diversification, and  fully utilized serving the needs of local industry.    7. No focus on advanced UCF is not well connected to innovations happening in  manufacturing additive/rapid manufacturing, including 3D printing.  It lacks a fabrication  lab that can support growth  of small businesses.    8. Location Central Florida is not yet perceive d as having the critical mass of high-tech  firms, investors, and infrastructure  present in regions like Silicon Valley,  NC Research Triangle, etc., which makes it challenging to attract businesses  and top faculty to the region.  So location emerges as both a strength and a   weakness.

These units meld creative arts,  modern digital media, and computer to provide cutting edge   training and research that supports  Central Florida's growing digital  entertainment industry.  The mi ddle image shows the 8th student  cohort trained by FIEA.  Many  graduates remain in the region  working with university partner and computer gaming giant   Electronic Arts, based in Orlando.  1.4.  Economic Engagement Planning  UCF\u2122s Strategic Plan 9 and Annual  Work Plan10 include strengthening the  region\u2122s economic and social ecosystem  by focusing on innovation and   workforce development that support  regional strengths in optics, life sciences  and medicine, aerospace, digital   entertainment, and simulation and  training.  This is being achieved in part  by establishing Centers and Institutes   that integrate with our 12 Colleges to  provide cutting-edge research and  workforce training in focus areas.  The   Centers and Institutes are profiled in the Case Studies and include, among others,  the Advanced Materials Processing and   Analysis Center, 11 NanoScience and  Technology Center, 12 Center for Research and Education in Optics and   Lasers (CREOL), 13 Florida Photonics  Center of Excellence,14 Townes Laser Institute,15 Institute for Simulation and  Training,16 Florida Solar Energy  Center,17 Biomolecular Science  Center,18 Center for Emerging Media 19 and the Florida Interactive  Entertainment Academy (Fig. 8). 20   The university leadership recognizes   9 http://www.ucf.edu/strategic-planning.  10 See for example the "UCF 201 2-2013 Work Plan", presente d to the Board of Governors,  State University System  of Florida, http://www.flbog.edu/documents_meetings/0133_0 624_4898_UCF_WP_ Presentation_2012- 13%20v2.pdf.  11 http://www.ampac.ucf.edu.  12 http://www.nanoscience.ucf.edu.  13 http://www.creol.ucf.edu.  14 http://www.creol.ucf.edu/About/FPCE.aspx.  15 http://www.townes.ucf.edu.  16 http://www.ist.ucf.edu.  17 www.fsec.ucf.edu. 18 http://med.ucf.edu/biomed.  19 http://cem.ucf.edu.  20 http://www.fiea.ucf.edu.

aV18  the importance of innovation and entrepreneurship.   To strengthen our leadership role as a catalyst for  venture creation, many entrepreneurial initiatives have  been launched over the last 15 years.  Substantial  financial investment has established a thriving entrepre neurial ecosystem at UCF.  Key elements of this  ecosystem are the Center for Entrepreneurial Lead ership (CEL), Engineering Leadership & Innovation  Institute (eli2), UCF Business Incubation Program (U CFBIP), Central Florida Research Park, Office of  Technology Transfer (OTT), Venture Accelerator ( VA), and the Florida Angel Nexus (FAN, see Table 6  and Case Studies).   Table 6.   Key Elements of UCF\u2122s Entrepreneurial Ecosystem.    1. Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership (CEL):  For nine years CEL has successfully educated, empowered and inspired entrepreneurial thought and  action, focusing on transitioning  technology into the marketplace.   2. Engineering Leadership & Innovation Institute (eli 2): For over six years eli 2 has encouraged and empowered STEM stud ents to create, innovate and transition  technology to student ventures.   3. UCF Business Incubation Program (UCFBIP):  With nine incubator sites in four counties across Central Florida, UCFBIP has helped 300+ emerging   companies create over $500 million in annual revenue.   4. Central Florida Research Park:  Located next to UCF\u2122s main campus, the Park empl oys 10,000+ people at 126 companies.  It is the  largest research park in Florida and fourth  largest in the US by number of companies.   5. Office of Technology Transfer (OTT):  UCF ranked as having the 3rd most impactful patent portfolio in academia in 2010 as reported by the  IEEE.21  In 2012, OTT received 127 disclosures and filed  154 patent applications and 74 issued patents  supporting UCF innovation. 22  6. Venture Accelerator (VA):  VA helped 600+ entrepreneurs, including over 90  faculty members, to commercialize technologies,  raising over $5 million through grants and private investment since 2010.   7. Florida Angel Nexus (FAN):  In 2012 UCF partnered with private investors crea ting FAN, an early-stage  investment firm that  connects companies to Florida investors and will match $1 million to three start-ups by end of 2013.     21 P.

aV19  1.5.  Promotion and Communication  As a relatively young university, UCF faces an ongoing  challenge in engaging alumni to support the  institution.  Consequently, in addition to the key c onstituencies of lawmakers, officials and community  supporters, the university has made major strides to  galvanize support from its 247,000 graduates.   Redesigned in 2012, Pegasus magazine engages alum ni and friends with professionally written and  colorfully designed pieces covering the breadth of the  university\u2122s reach \u0152 from athletics to prominent  alumni to groundbreaking research.  In the summer 2012 issue, the magazine profiled UCF\u2122s  commercialization process (Fig. 9) and is schedul ed to provide similar treatment for the UCF  entrepreneurship effort this winter.   These initiatives complement ongoing efforts by UC F Marketing, UCF News & Information, and  ORC's Marketing and Communications to position UCF  research prominently in the local, state and  national consciousness.  The ORC in particular  is consolidating its resources by creating a  Communications Council composed of news and ma rketing representatives from the UCFBIP, GrowFL  and the OTT to develop unified branding, to include  the Venture Central portal, and devise a strategic  campaign for implementing the brand statewide.  In Go al 1 of our Improvement Plan, we propose to take  this further by creating the Coordinated-Communications Council (C 3), which adds the communications  teams all units across campus.  An exciting additiona l component is the underwriting of targeted public  broadcasting programming aired on WUCF TV, which two years ago purchased the license for the  region\u2122s only PBS channel.  All of these effort s will strengthen UCF's messaging and help all  stakeholders appreciate the key role UCF plays in I&ED for the region.     1.6.  Advancing University Economic Engagement   Leadership in Economic Engagement   UCF is recognized for its innovation leadership.  By  establishing research strengths that align with the  region\u2122s economic interests, securing state investment in centers such as CREOL and FSEC, and by  developing novel vehicles for transitioning technology into the marketplace, UCF has had a profound  impact on Central Florida.  Established under th e leadership of President Hitt, the FHTCC was  acknowledged as an exceptional educational institution partnership by the International Economic  Development Council. 23  This year UCFBIP received the Incubation Network of the Year Award from the  National Business Incubation Association (NBIA),24 and Incubator of the Year in 2004. 25  Members of  this program are in leadership positions at nati onal and state business incubation associations.  Dr. Tom  O\u2122Neal, President of UCFBIP, is a member of NBIA Board of Directors and the President of the Florida  Business Incubation Association.  His work focu ses on establishing best practices for the association  based on UCF success.     23 http://www.floridahightech.com/ publication/newsrelease/2010-09-15- fhtcc-technology-based-economic- development.html.  24 http://www.nbia.or g/success_stories/awards/2013/u cf.php.  25 http://www.nbia.or g/success_stories/awards/2004/u cf.php.

aV21  Engagement with Peers at other Institutions   UCF benefits invaluably from engagement with  APLU and IEPA and contributes substantially to  these communities.  UCF has participated in the CIC EP Metrics Pilot Study.  Dr. Michael Georgiopoulos serves as member-at-large on the CICEP Implementa tion Committee and co-chair s the Development and  Maintenance Team for the Metrics Program.  We offere d all IEPA participants free use of our web-based  Assessment Tools application.  We also shared our  survey invitation letter and  modified language for the  Internal Assessment with the award participants.  UCF sent several of its team members to the  APLU/AAU University Economic Impact Workshop,  CICEP Summer Meeting, and the APLU National  and Annual Meetings.  Our active participation at th ese meetings has helped shape the process and led to  refinements disseminated to all participants.  UCF\u2122 s economic engagement leaders regularly share their  best practices in economic engagement throug h professional publications and presentations. 26  1.7.  Overall Innovation   Training and Research:  UCF faculty have c ontributed to the discovery of groundbreaking  technologies over a wide range of disciplines su ch as photonics, biotechnology, nanotechnology, and  computer vision with vast potential for commercializati on.  Discoveries include the world\u2122s shortest laser  pulse,27 innovative plant-based methods of making vaccines for some of the world\u2122s most devastating  diseases, 28 and use of cerium nanoparticles for everything from treating glaucoma to making efficient  building materials. 29   Technology Transfer:  In the past two years  UCF has won over $18 million in entrepreneurship related grants , including a $1.3 million Clean Tech Acceleration 30 grant from the US Economic   26 Selected publications:   (a) T.

These programs have solidified  innovative \ufb01next generation\ufb02 series of services for  bringing technologies from UCF and other research  universities in the Southeastern US to market by facilitating \ufb01demand pull\ufb02 relationships with large  corporate end users and strategic partners.  UCF h as a proven track record of translating technologies  from university research laboratories and classrooms into hundreds of companies. 32   Innovative Commercialization:  In addition to  traditional entrepreneurial offerings, UCF has established innovative programs.  GrowFL is a highly  regarded statewide \ufb01economic gardening\ufb02 program  that has become a national model fo r providing support to \ufb01stage-two\ufb02 33 companies.  Businesses engaged  with GrowFL grew 16.6% faster than their peers who  did not participate and 19.6% faster than Florida  companies overall.  Every dollar invested by the stat e of Florida in the GrowFL program returns $7.7 in  state and local taxes.     Transformative Research:  The Complex Adaptiv e Systems Laboratory (CASL) focuses on social and  economic complexity, in particular  on innovation networks, regional ec onomic impact of entrepreneurial  support organizations, and computer simulations that  serve as \ufb01wind-tunnels\ufb02 for economic policy testing.   CASL collects and evaluates data from all organizati ons in the UCF entrepreneurial ecosystem (i) to  improve practices and procedures and ( ii) to conduct research on how to bu ild robust, resilient and vibrant innovation-driven economies.   Economic prosperity  At UCF\u2122s 50 th anniversary gala in June more tha n1,100 attendees from across Central Florida  contributed $700,000 (when matched with state dollars ) for scholarships for first-generation students.  UCF\u2122s slogan, "UCF Stands for Opportunity", sign ifies the depth of our commitment to economic  engagement.  UCF has become integrally entrenched in  the region\u2122s economic, social and cultural growth.   Our case studies illustrate the impact that the developm ent of research centers and institutes, in concert  with regional needs, have had in educating students  and bringing top faculty expertise to bear on the  issues industry leaders face regularly.  The accomplishmen ts attributable to UCF\u2122s guiding principle of  partnership have been quantified by the numbers  of successful companies coming out of the university  and its local-government supported incubators, the e ducational opportunities created when the university  connects with elected leaders and economic developm ent professionals, and the lives that can change as a  result of higher education.   UCF has been shown to have an economic  impact of $19.6 billion 34 but the truer measure of prosperity can be seen in the Central Florida\u2122s transition from a community known for  citrus and tourism into a place where educated  young professionals, as profiled in Forbes magazine,  choose to live, work and thrive. 35 UCF is more than a partner with Central Florida, its presence has  transformed the community and made it a better place to live.   31 Megawatt Ventures (http://megawattventure s.com) is funded by a grant from  the U.S. Department of Energy (DE- SC0005499, $1,050,000.00), led by PI Dr. Thomas O\u2122Neal.  32See Case Study 3. 33Emerging growth companies with 10 - 50 employees and revenues of $1 million - $25 million. 34 Florida Board of Governors Economic Impact Study, Feb. 2012.  35 Forbes, Sept. 2011, http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacque lynsmith/2011/09/08/the-cities-with-the-happiest-young- professionals.

aV23  2.  Case Studies CASE STUDY :  UCF CENTERS AND  INSTITUTES   Overview  An essential component of UCF\u2122s economic development  strategy is the creation of research centers and  institutes that align with the economic needs of Cent ral Florida.  Centers give faculty the resources and  flexibility to conduct research in non-traditional areas  and help the university build on its reputation for  partnerships with industry and the community.  The r esearchers in these centers ha ve been responsible for  bringing in the university\u2122s largest single grant -  $55 million from NASA - have led the university to its  current ranking by IEEE as having the 20 th most powerful patents in the world in the university/education  category36, have started 37 companies and have 51 active licensing agreements.    The industry clusters and areas of UCF focus include:  - Optics & Photonics \u0152 CREOL, The College of Optics & Photonics - Simulation \u0152 The Institute for Simulation and Training  - Energy \u0152 The Florida Solar Energy Center  - Materials Science and Engineering \u0152 The Advan ced Materials Processing and Analysis Center  - Health Care \u0152 The Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences   - NanoScience \u0152 NanoScience Technology Center  - IT/Computer Science \u0152 The Center for Computer Vision  - Aerospace \u0152 The Florida Space Institute  In some cases these centers have grown into full   academic units such as the College of Medicine and the   College of Optics and Photonics, the first such college in   the country. The interconnect edness of research, industry  and subsequent funding oppor tunities offered by UCF\u2122s  centers and institutes helped the university earn  distinction by the Carnegie Foundation for the   Advancement of Teaching in 2010 as a \ufb01very high   research activity\ufb02 institution.  CREOL, The College of Optics & Photonics CREOL, The College of Optics and Photonics  (www.creol.ucf.edu) illustrates the economic benefit of   equipping faculty to focus  on selected areas of research.   The field of optics was identified as a critical component   of Central Florida\u2122s economy in the mid-1980s and  CREOL was first funded by the legislature in 1986.  By  2004 CREOL became the first College of Optics and   Photonics in the nation, enabling it to attract and offer   tenure to faculty focused on the emerging discipline.  In   2005 the College was awarded $10 million to create the  Florida Photonics Center of Excellence and, in 2006, the  Townes Laser Institute was established, firmly   entrenching the College as one of the premier optics   research institutes in the country.   36 http://spectrum.ieee.org/static/inter active-patent-power-2012#anchor_uni.

aV24    Assessing Impact  In 26 years CREOL faculty have created 23 spinof f companies and 250 patents, graduated 230 Ph.D.\u2122s  and partnered with 175 companies that support the colle ge as industrial affiliates.  In 2013 researchers at  the College earned $10.6 million in external research  funding.  With an increased US push for dominance  in optics and photonics, CREOL is well positi oned to lead a national research agenda.  The Institute for Simulation and Training  The Institute for Simulation and Training  (www.ist.ucf.edu) has become a vital national asset, a   world leader in its field, and the causal agent for the $3  billion simulation and modeling industry in Central   Florida.  The Institute has deliberately pursued   research, developed programs, hired faculty members,  and trained students to support what has evolved into  the center of the simulation and modeling industry in   America.     Assessing Impact  The importance of the Institute is reflected by its 130  graduate students, half of  whom are earning their  doctorate degree. Of those students, 85 percent join the   local simulation and modeling workforce.  The   centrality of the industry is attested to by the Navy-  sponsored annual Interservice Industry Training and  Simulation Conference that last year drew more than  20,000 registrants.  IST researchers are routinely  among the top-funded at UCF bringing in $99.5 million  in funding over the last decade.     Florida Solar Energy Center  The story of UCF\u2122s Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC)  (www.fsec.ucf.edu) begins with the energy crisis of 1973.  In   1975 the Florida Energy Committee and the Florida   Legislature established the first state-supported organization   dedicated to researching alternative energy sources.    Through the years FSEC has been focused on creating energy  independence and has led research, conducted workforce   training, developed educati on programs and certified solar  systems.    Assessing Impact  Through workforce training, FSEC has had a significant  impact in the community that  has struggled with the loss of the space shuttle program and more than 7,000 associated   jobs.37  In 2012 FSEC provided more than 55 short courses  which trained 748 professionals,  qualifying many of them for  certifications to provide energy services to consumers and   37 High Joblessness in the home of  U.S. space flight, 60 Minutes, http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162- 57407288/high-joblessness-in-t he-home-of-u.s-space-flight/  Fig. 11.

The center also coordinat es the award-winning $10 million SunSmart E-shelter  program which has installed more than 100 p hotovoltaic systems on emergency shelter schools  throughout Florida.  The federal and state-funded  project employed approximately 900 workers from 60  companies to install PV systems.  For its positiv e community impact the project was awarded an  honorable mention in the 2013 Photovolta ic Project of Distinction awards.  The value of FSEC contracts and grants ranges fro m $8 million to $12 million annually.  Total funding  since FSEC's inception in 1975 exceeds $130 million.  College of Medicine On May 17, 2013, 36 students graduated from  UCF\u2122s College of Medicine (www.med.ucf.edu)   and made American medical school history.  As   featured by  NBC Nightly News  these students  became the first class to ever receive full four-year  scholarships, and all graduated debt-free.   The   story of UCF\u2122s College of Medicine is a story   grounded in economic opportunity.  The life   sciences cluster forming around the College of   Medicine, approved in 2006, includes a VA  Medical Center, Sanford-Burnham Medical  Research Institute, the M.D. Anderson Center, and   Nemours Children\u2122s Hospital. The college has   more than 200 full-time faculty and staff members   and more than 1,200 volunteer and affiliate faculty  members and joint appointments.    Assessing Impact  By 2017, the College of Medicine, combined with a li fe sciences cluster, could create 30,000 jobs, $459.9  million in annual tax revenue, $2.8  billion in annual wages and $7.6  billion in annual economic activity. 38  Researchers at the College received $11,518,014 in  external research funding in 2013 and have founded  three startup companies.     38 Arduin, Laffer & Moore Econometrics,  UCF College of Medicine Economic Impact Report  http://bioorlando.com/core/file.php?loc=/Solodev/clients/solodev/Enterprise%20Main/Documents/EDC%20Docu ments/bioOrlando/press%20kit/UCFCollegeofMedicineEconomicImpact.pdf  .

aV26  CASE STUDY :  THE FLORIDA  HIGH TECH CORRIDOR  COUNCIL A mutually beneficial partnership between  university, Council, and regional stakeholders   The Florida High Tech Corridor Council (FHTCC) is a  cornerstone for UCF's partnership model and an  award-winning program that strategically encourages  high-tech development along Florida's Interstate-4  Corridor.   The FHTCC was conceived by UCF President   John C. Hitt, after UCF and the University of   South Florida (USF) offered research assistance   to Lucent Technologies, Inc. in a successful bid  to persuade them to keep their operations in   Florida, rather than relocating to Europe.   President Hitt thought this kind of university-  industry partnership should work on a much   broader scale and conceived of a permanent   partnership with local companies and  governments to pursue common economic   development goals.   Funded by the Florida   legislature in 1996, the FHTCC has grown to   include 23 counties, USF, the University of  Florida, 300 company partners, 20 local and   regional economic devel opment organizations, 14 community and state colleges and 12   regional workforce boards.    The Corridor works on multiple fronts, offering   $2 million a year in cash match for cooperative   work between industry and participating  universities,  promoting education and workforce  training, assisting entrepreneurs and second-stage companies, and working with state and local leader s to identify and initiate pro-industry legislation,  training programs and infrastructure building projects.     FHTCC helps new businesses grow and succeed   Industry leaders and research faculty alike herald  the Florida Matching Grants Research Program as the  key to the Council\u2122s effectiveness.   For scientists wh o may not be naturally inclined to partner with  companies, the prospect of obtaining matching funds to  subsidize their research is incentive enough to do  so.  And for startup companies that struggle to compet e for federal grants, the program is a lifeline.    The UCF spinout company OptiGrate illustrates that effect.     Fig. 14.   This nighttime image from the NASA Earth  Observatory/NOAA NGDC shows that the Florida High   Tech Corridor, spanning from  the state\u2122s central east coast  to Tampa Bay in the west, has a high level of activity,   which is comparable to traditional industry clusters in the   northeast.

aV27  Leon Glebov, a research  scientist at UCF\u2122s Center for Research and Education in Optics   and Lasers (CREOL), developed a technology   for recording high efficiency volume   holographic gratings.  He started a company,   OptiGrate Corporation, to commercialize the   technology and make it available to the   government and defense industry.  The   company began investing funds into UCF for   sponsored research and obtained matching   funds through the FHTCC.  Since 1999,   OptiGrate has invested a total $1.9 million into   research, matched with $1 million from the   FHTCC.  Glebov credits the model with helping   his company secure more than $9 million in govern ment contracts to date.  Today the company has  moved to a new manufacturing facility, employs 30 pe ople (with an average salary of $45,000 per year)  and last year received the President\u2122s Award from the Manufacturers Association of Central Florida.
p1855
aVEducation and workforce training  The FHTCC has partnered with member workforce  boards and colleges to offer advanced technical  degrees, recertification programs, and teacher tr aining workshops.  A $1.1 million investment with  colleges and universities has created 2+2 associate degree programs in high-tech fields ranging from   microelectronics manufacturing to modeling, simula tion & training.   For middle and secondary school  students the Corridor has sponsored 63 techCamps,  utilizing STEM educators from 23 school districts to  introduce potential careers in areas such as opti cs & photonics, microelectronics and life sciences.    Impacts: Measuring Success of the Florida High Tech Corridor Council   The Corridor's impact is tracked by both the  FHTCC and independent research bodies, including  Innovation Insight, a Florida research consulting  firm specializing in market and technology  intelligence.39    Since establishment, the FHTCC has partnered with 20 economic development agencies, 14 community  colleges, 350 companies, and hundreds of university  faculty members to fund more than 1,100 applied  research projects.
p1856
aVThe $53 million invested by FHTCC has been matched  by corporate cash, federal grants and in-kind  investments exceeding $148 million.  This investme nt has generated an additional $731 million in  quantifiable downstream impacts.     39"The Economic Impact of the Florida High Tech Corr idor Council\u2122s Matching Gr ant Research Program", an  economic impact study prepared by Innovation Insight (now Tucker/Hall, Inc., http://www.tuckerhall.com),  17 August 2009.

aV28  The FHTCC match has engaged 2,170 graduate stude nts in side-by-side research, many of whom  ultimately receive employment offers from industry partners.  A study 40 of the program\u2122s downstream  impact concluded that 3,276 jobs were created  between 1995 and 2009.  On average, the program  stimulates creation of one job for every $16,189 invested   a far lower job creation cost than traditional  economic development ventures.     The FHTCC benefits companies at all levels, from  start-ups to Fortune 500s.  It has fueled the  development of UCF's nationally ranked Business Incuba tion Program, which has been  shown to return at least $5.25 for every dollar invested. 41  Lockheed Martin and Siemens in  Orlando have engaged in 81 and  61 grant projects, respectively.  The FHTCC invested  $2.5 million in 30 applied research endeavors with  Harris Corporation in Melbourne, Florida, which the company matched with more than $6 million in cash  and equipment.  Harris estimates the partners hip has generated more than $100 million in  communications technology value.

aVSpreading the wealth: FHTCC is a model for peer institutions  The FHTCC model has been widely recognized and  emulated.  President Randy Berridge recently  received the highest honor bestowed by the Flor ida Economic Development Council, the 2013 Eunice  Sullivan Economic Development Professional of  the Year award.  The Governor\u2122s Economic  Development Transition Team has recommended that the FHTCC be duplicated statewide, 42 and in 2010  the Presidential Task Force on Space Industry Workforce & Economic Development 43 credited the I-4 Corridor universities with \ufb01driving innovation and th e creation of new businesses in emerging fields such  as simulation technology, advanced robotics, and software.\ufb02     The program has also been a model for organizations as diverse as H arvard\u2122s Kennedy School of  Government, the city of Chiang Mai, Thailand  and the Dallas Regional Ch amber of Commerce.

aV29    CASE STUDY :  THE UCF BUSINESS  INCUBATION  PROGRAM AND  GROWFL Overview   The University of Central Florida (UCF) is dedicated to accelerating the commercialization of  technologies developed within the university and  region, and enhancing economic growth in the state.    Two university initiatives, the UCF Business  Incubation Program (UCFBIP) and the Economic  Gardening Institute\u2122s GrowFL, together have helped companies create more than 7,400 direct and  indirect new jobs since 1999.
p1861
aVThe UCFBIP44 partners with local governments to provide early-stage companies with the tools, training  and infrastructure they need to be successful and  create high-growth technology business.  Since its  founding in 1999, this selective program has worked with  more than 225 companies, helping them secure  over $400 million in investor capita l.  The Incubator Program has grown from its initial class of six  companies to 128 clients in nine locations throug hout Central Florida.  The UCFBIP has gained  recognition as a national model and  was named Incubator Network of the Year in 2013 by the National  Business Incubation Association.

aV  GrowFL45 was introduced in 2009 to help successful small co mpanies grow to the next level.  As the only  statewide organization focused exclusively on em erging and established second-stage companies,  GrowFL uses strategic research and peer-to-peer mentoring to help those companies grow sales and create   jobs.  Among other requirements, eligible businesses mu st produce a viable product or service and have no more than 100 employees.   The unique quality of the UCFBIP and GrowFL progra ms is that they emphasize collaboration between  local governments, economic development  agencies and the university.

aV30  GrowFL, together with the Edward Lowe Foundation, produces an annual awards program that celebrates  growing second-stage companies headquartered in Florida.  The program is a unique way to recognize  and honor second-stage companies that demonstrate  high performance in the marketplace with innovative  strategies and processes that make them \ufb01worth watchi ng\ufb02.  Now in its third year, Florida Companies to  Watch has recognized 100 second-stage growth comp anies (50 in 2011; 50 in 2012) and has just  announced the Class of 2013. Each year, economic  impact numbers are published to show the  significance of these companies within the state of Florida.
p1865
aVEconomic Impact  The UCFBIP has had a direct economic impact of mo re than $363 million per year.  Every dollar local  governments invest in its incubators returns  approximately $5 to invigorate its communities. 46  Since the original pilot program began in 2009 th rough the end of fiscal year 2013 (June 30, 2013),  GrowFL has contributed more than $581.4 million to  Florida\u2122s economy. The comp anies that participated  in the state funded program helped to increase stat e and local net tax revenues by $42.3 million. Every  dollar invested by the state of Florida in the Grow FL program returns $7.7 in state and local taxes.     The Class of 2011 Companies to Watch winners re port 28% annual revenue  growth and 21% annual  growth in employees (from 2006-2009). Combined , the 2011 companies projected a 25% revenue  increase and 35% growth in employees during 2010. For the winning Class of 2012, these companies  reflect a 32% annual revenue gr owth and 23% annual growth  in employees (from 2008-2011).   Combined, these companies projected a 35% revenue increase and 37% growth in employees during  2012.

aV31    Jobs Created  The UCFBIP has directly generated 1,950 jobs since  1999.  In addition, 2,250 indirect jobs can be  attributed to the program for a total of 4,200.  These  jobs generate an average wage that is 45 percent  above the average wage in the area.  GrowFL helped more than 400 companies create 2,067  new direct jobs since 2009. In addition, the program is credited with helping companies create 911  indirect and 1,209 induced-effect jobs for a total  of 4,187 jobs. As a comparison, second-stage growth  companies engaged with the GrowFL program grew  16.6% faster than their peers who did not particip ate and 19.6% faster than all Florida companies.  Currently, companies receiving GrowFL services are tr ending at approximately 4.5 new jobs per year. 47   Success Story: Engineering &  Computer Simulations, Inc.

The company was named one of America\u2122s 500  fastest growing private companies by Inc. magazine  in 2009.  In 2010 ECS received the National Small  Business of the Year award because of its  commitment to employees, involvement in the   community and customer satisfaction.  Through  work with the military, ECS became one of the first  companies in the world to repurpose commercial  video game technology to  support education and  learning.    Armstrong credits GrowFL\u2122s CEO peer roundtabl es with helping him grow his company from 25  employees when he started the program to 56 employees today.  After graduation from UCF, Armstrong  moved out of the area but he decided to move back to  start his company.  The biggest reason, he says, is  the UCF\u2122s strength in modeling and simulation.  At least half of his employees are UCF graduates and  nearly a quarter from the university\u2122s  Institute for Simulation and Training.

Activity 3.6:  Focus alumni engagement at   the college/department-level.  Already  underway and   ongoing. New outreach teams; some   are already in  place (e.g.,  Eng., Optics). Activity 3.7:  Leverage communication of   UCF successes (Goal 1)  increase Alumni contributions. Start Sept.  2013 and  ongoing. Strong internal communication  structure to  ensure  coherent   messaging. Activity 3.8:  Inform alumni of programs  that match their gifts.  Start Sept.  2013 and ongoing. No significant resources needed.  Activity 3.9:  Review programs/policies to  ensure students have a   positive experience at UCF.   Already  underway and  ongoing. No significant resources needed.    3.2. Goal 1:  Improve Communicat ion of UCF Services and Successes in  Economic Engagement The objectives are to: 1. Break down barriers that undermine messaging;  2. Raise awareness among all stakeholders  of UCF's economic engagement;  3. Increase access to I&ED services for in ternal and external stakeholders; 4. Ensure messaging is supported by success st ories, to boost credibility and patronage;  5. Increase one-on-one outreach to create business  confidence that leads to partnerships;   Coordinated-Communications Council: "C 3"  The C 3 will be established and populated by top ad ministrators from Office of the President,  Academic Affairs, Research & Commercialization, Colleges/Centers, Office of Economic Development,  incubation and entrepreneurship programs, Marke ting, and Alumni Relations.  It will include  communications staff in those units who deve lop content and implement strategies.  C 3's activities will be:  1. Review existing messaging of I&ED successes and services across all units and media;  2. Evaluate data from this IEPA process and othe r sources to assess how internal and external  audiences perceive existing messaging;  
p1873
aV36  3. Develop a coordinated-messaging plan to better communicate services and more clearly promote  successes as achievement in I&ED;  4. Revise content unit by unit to bring communica tion of services and successes in line with the  plan; 5. Initiate formative assessment of communication,  which encompasses the annual IEPA process  and includes third-party media (e.g., local and national news).   C3 will coordinate internal and external communications across all media   including web-based,  social media, traditional print, and broadcast media.   Effective internal communication informs faculty,  staff, parents, and students, who hopefully become  satisfied customers and generous alumni.  Effective  external messaging raises the reputation of the ins titution and encourages more external investment,  including partnerships with local and regional gove rnment, federal grants and contracts, and alumni  contributions.   One example of a specific deliverable is as follows.  C 3 will revise the current I&ED webpage (which is accessed through four clicks from the homepag e) to unify content from Office of Research &  Commercialization, Office of Economic Development,  etc. and make it a single-click accessible portal  that showcases I&ED as a major activity, on par with  Academics, Campus Life, etc.  The new portal will  be a "one-stop shop" for learning how UCF can be le veraged for research, starting a business, developing  entrepreneurial skills, licensing technology, and that  smoothly directs visitors to the corresponding people  and units.    Increasing Use of One-on-One Personal Outreach   Business decisions, like partnering with UCF, are  driven by trust built on personal contacts.  Our  communications strategy will expand personal co mmunication between internal and external  stakeholders, to strengthen the f oundation for partnership.  This  will be achieved through activities  implemented in coordination with the Office of R esearch & Commercialization, Office of Economic  Development, the UCF Business Incubator a nd GrowFL Programs.  These activities include:  1. Deploying staff into the field to meet leaders in regional industry, assess their needs, and match  them to UCF services and personnel;  2. Bringing industry leaders to UCF for tours in relevant research departments/centers/institutes to  experience capabilities first hand; and 3. Using personal contact to disseminate informa tion about existing solutions and intellectual  property licensing opportunities.   3.3. Goal 2: Improve the Reputation of UCF   Improving UCF's reputation will provide added va lue for our students, alumni, and community;  increase our ability to attract funding and alumni contri butions; and make UCF more attractive to external  stakeholders for partnerships of all kinds.   The objectives associated with this goal are to:  
p1874
aV37  1. Enhance the recruitment, progression, and retention of top-ranked faculty;  2. Increase graduate degree program breadth, interdi sciplinarity, and quality, while enhancing the  volume and impact of UCF research; and  3. Increase six-year undergraduate completion rate  from 65% to 70%, or higher, within 5 years.   Activities will include the following:  1. Work through C3 to promote areas of innovation with na tional and international repute (e.g.,  CREOL, Simulation and Training, FHTCC).  2. Pursue selective and targeted faculty recruitment in STEM, emerging fields, and programs of  strategic emphasis, particularly disciplines that serve regional growth areas of optics, aerospace,   medical technology, digital entertai nment, and simulation and training.  3. Use predictive analytics and other technology  enhancements to identify vulnerabilities along  students' path toward graduation.  Establish  support structures at the program, department, and  college level which help students through these pitfalls. 4. Strengthen existing programs that provide support to  students along the path to degree.  Examples  include targeted freshman and sophomore guidance/career counseling, 49 Student Academic  Resource Center, 50 Supplemental Instruction, 51 and the University Writing Center. 52 5. Continue to support and  expand living-learning communities that  foster students' engagement  with the University and improve student rete ntion and performance.  Examples at UCF are  LEARN53, EXCEL54, and COMPASS.55  All three are NSF-sponsored programs  that support STEM students.  EXCEL was recently institu tionalized with support from the Provost.  6. Continue to support and expand scholarships  and mentoring programs focused on vulnerable  groups, like minorities and first-generation colle ge students, such as UCF's McNair Program. 56 7. Continue to support and expa nd programs that involve undergraduates in research,  entrepreneurship, and internships; pairs them  with faculty and industry mentors; and provides  training in research methods and ethics.

Activities 2 - 4 are \ufb01Key Initiatives\ufb02 that are championed by President Hitt and are already underway,  with all necessary resources allocated.  They also map  directly onto the institution\u2122s and state\u2122s Strategic  Goals.61  3.4. Goal 3: Increase Non-State Funding for UCF Programs   In the past five years, UCF has lost 49 percent of  its state support, and there is little expectation that  additional funding from this source is forthcoming.  Th is appears to be a national trend and one which we  all must acknowledge and address.  One constructiv e approach for handling this problem is to seek  funding for programs from sources other than the state,  particularly through partnerships that lead to  I&ED.  Thus, increasing research funding in partnership with industry, promoting innovation and  technology transfer, and encouraging entrepreneursh ip are all vehicles that could not only increase  revenues and reputation for the institution, but  also serve regional needs by fostering I&ED.   In this component of the improvement plan, our  objectives are to (1) increase sponsored research  from the FY2012 value of $129M to $200M by 30 June 2016; and (2) double alumni contributions by  30 June 2023.  This will be achieve d through the following activities.  1. Revise the university I&ED plan to chart a pa th toward Central Florida becoming a "Silicon  Valley" focused on regional strengths that incl ude aerospace and defense, medical technology,  digital entertainment, and simulation and training.   2. Continue hiring new faculty in these areas of strategic regional interest (per Activity 2.2) who can  attract extramural funding and industry sponsorship.  3. Promote entrepreneurship among faculty and stude nts via the newly established Venture Central,  so their successes down the road can generate licensing revenue and sponsored research,  following the model of Rini Technologies (see Case Studies).  4. Leverage one-on-one outreach (Activity 1.7, 1. 8, 1.9) and improved communication of I&ED  services and successes to creating better alignment be tween innovators and investors, resulting in  more industry-sponsored research, tech-transfer and licensing.   57 http://ramp.ucf.edu.  58 http://www.sra.ucf.edu.  59 YES is an NSF-funded program (DUE-0806931; $675,000 with $75,000 internal match) led by PI and Dean of  Engineering Dr. Mich ael Georgiopoulos.  60 CF-STEM is funded by the Department of Labor (HG227291260A12; $7,915,525) with a 50% internal in-kind  and cash match and administered by Assoc.

aV39  5. Focus alumni engagement at the college/departm ent-level, where graduates are most likely to  have the strongest sense of identity.  6. Leverage improved communication of UCF successes  (Goal 1) to increase Alumni contributions.   This will complement current planning by th e UCF Foundation to launch a $500 million capital  campaign.  7. Encourage giving by informing alumni of programs that will match their gift for graduate student  support, either in the alumnus' area of stud y, or in areas of known regional strength.  8. Ensure students have a positive experience at UCF, starting with the freshman year, and inform  them of the great things happening at their in stitution, so they become more engaged and are  more likely to be generous alumni following gra duation.  This is already occurring in several  ways.  For example, the Graduate College is re viewing graduate student policies, pay scales, and  graduation requirements to ensure that programs  follow best practices.  Other examples include  support and expansion of reten tion-boosting programs listed in Goal 2, like living-learning  communities, undergraduate research, scholarship s, and targeted freshman/sophomore advising  and mentoring.    3.5. Conclusion   The IEPA process provided a context  for focused, intense self-assessment.  It   has highlighted accomplishments and  strengths for the University, as well as some significant but correctable   weaknesses.  These were recognized by  external stakeholders and internal  stakeholders across the institution.  To  address the short-comings, we have  developed Goals and Objectives  complemented by thoughtful and   effective activities that will provide  sustainable benefits over the long term.   For all activities, the lack of funding is   the primary barrier to implementation.  However,  as Table 7 shows, many of these improvement activities  are already underway, with funds and personnel having  been allocated by key units, including Academic  Affairs, Office of Research & Commercialization, a nd the Office of Undergraduate Studies.  Importantly,  the plan moves away from dependency on the State fo r additional funds, instead addressing the challenges through integrated and complementary approaches.   Overall, the plan, even if partially successful, will  add value for our students, our alumni, and members  of our community, who look to UCF as the region\u2122s  driving force for innovation and economic development.

While UC has sought external stakeholder in put in the past, a formal assessment of internal  stakeholders related to economic engagement was a new process for us. Overall findings showed   improvem ent. Internal Stakeholders have uneven awareness and compartmentalized participation.  External stakeholders view UC as essential to regional economic growth and vitality. Many program -  ry is a well - kept secret, with many   opportunities and how to access them. External stakeholders indicated strong interest in partnering with  UC on economic engag ement initiatives to raise the bar.

aV A rea 1:    Establishing an Infrastructure for Engagement     Main Problems/Desired Outcomes   With  the   increasing importance  of   engagement  at UC and many notable engagement initiatives already  in place , there is a need for a  campus - wide   infrastructure to guide, support and facilitate the Innovation  and Engagement missions of the University. Issues identified include:

aVLack of a  comprehens ive and easily searchable  repository of university resources   for   internal  and external stakeholders     No    university  system and connecting with resources     Assessment Methods:   Both qua ntitative and qualitative data identified  campus - wide  infrastructure   for community/economic  engagement   as a growth area. Assessment of internal stakeholders utilized the CICEP - IAT , which  provided a comprehensive framework for assessment and generated quant itative data regarding major  issues and perceived performance. However, the CICEP - IAT    current initiatives. This led to the development of the UC - IAQ  to  focus on awareness, importance, and  perceived effectiveness o f UC - specific economic engagement drivers.    Qualitative  information   from  the  group s   involved in the 2011 Regional Task Force   and the UC Retreat   (involving   internal and external  stakeholders ) was also used . Th is   combination of approaches was highly complementary and provided  the breadth and depth needed to develop a complete picture of the issues and potential solutions.
p1920
aVUniversity Level of  Problem Recog n ition :     Most  administrative  levels  and faculty involved in economic engagement  are aware of the need for  better coordination and supporting infrastructure. In 2007 ,   a working group  of faculty and  administrators  craft ed   a solution , which received    for UC.  However, permanent resources were not committed, and no further progress  occurred . The IEPA  assessment process identified  the same
p1921
aVas an even higher high priority need,  given the significant increase in engagement activities th at has occurred since 2007 .     Supporting metrics :   In evaluating significance by ES, at least one or more items in each category of the CICEP - IAT could be  tracked back to infrastructure needs. The UC - IAQ data indicate d   the need for greater visibility   for  eco nomic/community engagement ,  something which   a formalized infrastructure would be capable of  addressing.
p1922
aVSuccess Indicators:     A central infrastructure would allow UC to emerge as a true  Center for the City   in economic engagement .   UC   would be viewed as a f acilitator for collaborations and a first choice partner for solving regional  issues. Evidence of success include s   increased partnerships and initiatives with documented impact s   for  both UC and its partners.
p1923
aV Barriers   to Success :   1.   Turf issues  associated  with formalized infrastructure   2.   Financial resource   requirements   for an  effective  infrastructure   3.   Limited perceived value of participating in community economic engagement   among some faculty     Required  Resources:   Infrastructure will involve seed costs for  staffing the Front Door Concept and for  support of a newly  developed Resource Catalog for UC.    Addressing Turf Issues does not require financial resources, but will  need to be addressed as part of the development of policies and procedures, in order to gen erate trust.   Culture change through education and reward systems  is  essential to changing our ecosystem (See Area  2 below) .
p1924
aV Area 2: Incentivizing Culture Change     Main Problems/Desirable Outcomes :   Having a culture that embraces community/economic engageme nt is core to success.  This is  a complex   deeply rooted .    is  simple at a superficial level   but offers the greatest challenges to  advancing  innovation and economic  engagement.  Two primary issues underpin this problem:
p1925
aV Current Reappointment, Promotion and Tenure (RPT) criteria align with traditional values of  teaching, research/scholarship and service to the university,  and do   not   include  community/economic engagement.  C hanging  RPT criteria is complicated at UC  as   no central  guidelines governing RPT   exist . Decisions occur at the faculty/department level,  which makes  uniform incorporation of community engagement into RPT guidelines more challenging .  Consequently, faculty is motiva ted to concentrate on engaging in areas which current RPT  criteria recognize and reward.
p1926
aV Community engagement is not  universally   understood by faculty,   resulting in some not  recognizing this as an opportunity for participation. Developing an understanding   that  engagement includes both social and economic is key to motivating faculty to build engagement  into their value framework.
p1927
aVAssessment Methods:   The CICEP - IAT was the primary vehicle for assessment, with qualitative validation from the UC Retreat.   A  review of department and college RPT criteria was previously done, and these result s   were also  factored into the identification of  this area for growth. Currently, only the Biomedical Engineering  Department and College of Allied Health include engagement i n their RPT criteria.     University Level of  Problem Recog n ition :   This  issue  has been discussed and recognized at the highest administrative level s of the university,  colleges and departments.  However, for meaningful change to occur, the discussion must  shift to  engaging all ranks of faculty. There is a supportive base of f aculty  who are  already engaged   in the  community/economic engagement agenda of the University, but   they  must be able to influence those  more comfortable with   status quo .
p1928
aVUniversity of  Cincinnati IEPA Application   Page  10     Supporting  M et rics :   Key indicators on the CICEP -     administrative input at the UC Retreat was uniformly positive about the need for change, but those  participating reflected a more engaged group.     Success Indicators:   Social and/or economic engagement would be  proportionally recognized in all college and department  RPT guidelines ,   along with   teaching, research/scholarship and service to UC .     It   would be  viewed as a  core value   that is   embraced   by all levels of UC leadership   and faculty .     Barriers   to Success :   1.   Trad itional views of the role of the university in the community   2.   Lack of understanding of the  potential impact of university engagement to  the well - being of the  community    3.   A number of interested and engaged faculty, but no   core group   organized   to lead the proc ess  for expansion of   the rewards/recognition system
p1929
aVRequired  Resources:   The most important  starting  resource  is   UC  faculty   members   who have already embraced economic  engagement. Th ey   must be  supported by a clear vision   for economic engagement  from  top  administrative levels . Engaged faculty  should   be encouraged and rewarded to take on a leadership role  in creating change.   R ecruitment of new faculty to the university with a  record   of economic engagement  should be considered as part of the criteria in allo cation of funding for new hires . The resources  allocated for establishing an Innovation and Economic Engagement Infrastructure   (See Area 1)   will also  help to educate faculty on the importance of engagement and facilitating their involvement.
p1930
aV Area 3:    Strategic Communication Plan Focused on Economic Prosperity     Main Problems/Desirable Outcomes :   A communication plan is needed that conveys a unified brand expression of UC   as   a fully engaged  University  that is  broadly recognized as a resource in building t he community. Issues identified include:     1.   Communication, as it relates to economic engagement, has been fragmented and not well  integrated into brand identity ;   2.   Many colleges have their own communications staff person, making it more difficult to create  uni fied messaging;   3.    resources, resulting in  limited    for advancing economic prosper ity ;     4.   There is a need  for increased  intentional ity   in outcomes to be generated as a result of the  communication effort rather than only serving to inform .
p1931
aVUniversity of  Cincinnati IEPA Application   Page  11     Assessment Methods:    Both quantitative and qualitative data support the development of a Strategic   Communications Plan as a  priority. Assessment strategies used to make this determination included the CICEP Internal Assessment  Tool, the UC  Internal Assessment Questionnaire   and subjective feedback from the 2011 Regional  Innovation Task Force Initiative   and the UC Retreat .
p1932
aVUniversity Level of Problem Recognition:   T here is  an increasingly evolving  recogni tion at all levels of the  need for a communication strategy that  keeps pace with the expanding mission and expectations of the university . Evidence of  this was found in   activities.
p1933
aV Supporting Metrics:   Nearly all categories of the CICEP Internal Assessment Tool provided insights into the  narrow   understa nding faculty and staff ha ve    Internal  Assessment Questionnaire   was particularly  informative   regarding how little internal knowledge of major  program initiatives there  is   beyond those  individuals  most immed iately involved. Subjective information  from external stakeholders who participated in the 2011 Regional Innovation Task Force focus groups  and the UC Retreat  provided significant confirmation that UC  has not   effectively convey ed   the breadth  and depth of U
p1934
aVSuccess Indicators:     A successful Economic Engagement Communications Strategic Plan would establish a University brand of  being a major resource and partner across stakeholder groups   and result in increased interactions in  community enga gement opportunities.     Barriers   to Success :     Influencing perceptions is difficult and not a near - term win .     Strategic Communications is essential,  but  must be adequately resourced   and   involve all areas of the  university , rather than   just one appointed office .
p1935
aV Culling out the most critical messages and telling a consistent story rather than covering the  waterfront is a politically charged endeavor capable of alienating people.     Required Resources:    An investment of human and financial resources will be required to plan, organize, and effectively  communicate to our various audiences, particularly internal audiences.  Funding will be required for  a  Communications Assistant or Agency   to coordinate implem entation of the Strategic Plan ,   and for  development of a  Communications Vehicle , such as a   community impact e - newsletter/newsletter ,   and  other communications/events.

The Center  could not have been developed without  this strong University - Industry dynamic in  place and the assets and needs that each   bring to the project.
p1960
aVTAKING PARTNERSHIP TO A NEW LEVEL:   The P&G/UC Simulation Center idea was originally a direct reapplication of what Caterpillar  launched   with the University of Illinois (UIUC), called the  Champaign Simulation Center   (CSC).  However, there are several unique features that have been important in the P&G/UC success.   whereas Caterp  edge of the University Campus rather than at the P&G facilities for easy access for students and  faculty to work on projects during any open schedule opportunities.  These ap proaches, along  with providing clear guidelines for IP ownership and  having  on - site relationship leaders from  both P&G and UC, allow students, faculty and researchers to focus on individual projects and  areas of expertise without disruption.

To date, more than 60 projects have gone through the Simulation Center, which  has resulted in nearly $5 M in direct funding from P&G.   N umerous publications and conference  presentations have  also  resulted from work at the Simulation Center.  Students who work at  the center have contributed to meaningful innovations for P&G, leading to intellectual property  d evelopment  and measurable business benefits for the company.
p1963
aV As of early 2013, P&G has hired 10 out of the 110 UC students that have worked at the P&G/UC  Simulation Center   -   a significant number ,   given the challenging economic times.  P&G sees this  as a     - relevant skills through the combined mentorship  of industry and university experts, making them attractive job candidates   for P&G and other  companies.
p1964
aVP&G has continually increased funding to the Simulation Center as a result of successful  projects.  In late 2012, P&G and UC agreed to a five year, $5  m illion base funding level ($1  million per year).  P&G estimates that this   partnership has provided them with greater than  a  7x  return in  business impact on their investment.     P&G is working with UC to seek additional  funding through state and federal opportunities   to continue to grow this initiative .
p1965
aV ADDRESSING BARRIERS AND   SUCCESS FACTORS:   The negotiation of Intellectual Property Rights was addressed up front, with a goal of  establishing policies that are a win for both sides.  In this partnership, P&G has exclusivity to the  intellectual properties developed in the course o f the project work ,   but UC faculty and students  retain the ownership of prior technology used for the project, as well as for applications outside  of P&G interests.  This agreement is progressive and one that has enabled the Center to  flourish.
p1966
aV The righ t leadership is always an issue  in   achieving success. Both P&G and UC made it an early  priority to identify highly committed leaders from both sides who would work collaboratively to  share risk and benefit, think outside the box and follow - through on commi tments.     Bureaucracy issues are often problematic in establishing highly complex initiatives that involv e  financial, intellectual property, operating, and lease agreements. The resulting frustrations and  delays affect relationship building, especially when   the relationship is in its early stage of  development. While these issues had to be navigated, use of the UC - P&G  M aster  A greement  mitigated many of these issues.   Ultimately ,   success was achieved through very deliberate  setups ,   including deployment of full - time managers from UC and P&G, clear support from both  upper managements and  commitment   on both sides to stay focused on the goal and think  creatively to address the challenges that  might  arise.  In fact, the planning team never lost sight  of the need to  focus on the core win - win outcomes that were driving the project.  The  experience of P&G in working with universities through its Connect+Develop Program was also

aVUniversity of  Cincinnati IEPA Application   Page  20     Case Study     The University of Cincinnati Rese  Intellectual Property   THE PROJECT:    (UC) ability to impact the community  economic growth and development is having  an effective interface for faculty and student  interacti ons with its business and community  partners. To address this need, UC created the  University of Cincinnati Research Institute  (UCRI).  UCRI is an independent ,   not - for - profit 501(c)(3) which serves three primary  needs of  UC and the community: First is  to  serve industrial clients who  require   the  services of internationally recognized  faculty   experts at UC in a timely and efficient manner   and provide access to  highly specialized  facilities and equipment that industry would  otherwise have to develop or pu rchase  themselves. This functionality is important in  attracting local, national and international  industries to partner with  UC in   performing  sponsored research.  S econd is to provide an  efficient mechanism  for faculty and students  from all colleges to   com mercializ e technology   and   non - technology - based intellectual property,  including specialized consulting services and training programs.  Valuable  commercialization  opportunities are typically missed by not including all types of   intellectual property   unique   to a  university .  T hird is to provide  UC students with experiential   learning experiences   with industry  partners, and to learn about commercialization and future opportunities for commercializing their  ideas.
p1972
aV   A SOLUTION FOR AN ENTIRE UNIVERSITY:   While t he use of a  501(c)(3)   by a university is not unique with respect to industry sponsored  research efforts by faculty and students, most such institutes focus heavily, if not exclusively, on  the commercialization of technology. By its very nature, this approa ch excludes the participation  by those faculty not engaged in new technology development. To fully capitalize and leverage  the potential of the university, we must recognize that a significant amount of intellectual  property (IP) in any university cannot b e held or touched! By definition, such a narrow view of  commercialization and IP ignores the rich opportunities of commercialization in areas such as  liberal arts, fine arts, education, criminal justice, design, planning and law. Key to the opening of  UCRI   was to develop opportunities for all of our colleges at UC.
p1973
aVUniversity of  Cincinnati IEPA Application   Page  21     A NEW WAY OF DOING BUSINESS:   UCRI  was designed to    compelling need to establish UCRI  comes  from the desire of local (and other) i ndustrial leaders  such as General Electric Aviation (GEA)   and Proctor & Gamble   to have a research partner that  can expedite and advance their research needs to build on  their  economic growth  as an industry .  In addition, UCRI provide s   the proper environment   to promote commercialization of  IP   throughout   the university.  As such,  UCRI has an opportunity to significantly grow our industrial  research funding base and provide synergisms that will undoubtedly reach into the classroom.  Establishing such industry par tnerships is an essential element for overall growth of our research  base which will provide future opportunities for innovation at UC.     THE IMPACT:   UCRI was approved for business on May 22, 2012 by the UC Board of Trustees. Within the first  year of operation, new business accounting of $1,600,000 was created through industry  partnerships or commercialization from the Colleges of Engineering and Applie d Science  (CEAS); Education, Criminal Justice and Human Services (CECH); and the College of  Medicine. Promoting regional industry growth,  UCRI  has developed a partnership with General  Electric Aviation (GEA) to help   develop the next generation of jet engin es.  Currently, UCRI has  contractual  commitments from GEA for $2,000,000 annually over the next three years . In   support   of this partnership, GEA/UCRI   was   recently awarded  an  Ohio Third Frontier  Research  and Development Center Attraction Program award of $5 ,000,000   as a collaborative effort  between GEA and CEAS .  The technical areas covered under this award will allow  UCRI   to  support GEA in their efforts to remain  an international leader in aviation jet engine development.  T he state of Ohio is currently a st rong player in th e global aviation jet engine   market, and UCRI  will  allow us to better contribute   to this success through its competitive research programs.
p1974
aV UCRI serve s   to develop commercial centers   in all of its colleges. As a second example of non - technology commercialization within UCRI, the CECH opened a   Criminal Justice Center   through which  faculty  provides   technical   and training   services to local, regional and national law  enforcement,  prisons,  cities and states. This Center currently generates over $1,500,000 annually  in contract ual   revenue . A third example of the broad range of activities incorporated within  UCRI was the creation of a unique consulting firm as a brand within UCRI invol ving all of the  faculty from CEAS called
p1975
aVenhance and promote  the   research base   within CEAS , and to enhance   and expand the  availability  of expertise   in CEAS   to industry   to address their need for i mmediate problem solving and  assistance in troubleshooting daily problems encountered within industry.    p rojects will be of short - term duration (less than 4 months) and consist primarily of consultation  and/or access to facilities and equipme nt for testing. For longer term  projects,   the standard CEAS  operational plan for industry sponsored research in UCRI will apply.  To date, all faculty within  CEAS have agreed to participate and have signed contractual agreements with UCRI to  participate.
p1976
aV  LOOKING TO THE FUTURE:   While UCRI will enhance commercialization opportunities for university intellectual property,  the real value of UCRI is to enhance industry partnerships as a means of expanding our research  opportunities   throughout the university system. Commercialization of intellectual property is  
p1977
aVUniversity of  Cincinnati IEPA Application   Page  22     best served through a vigorous and sizable research base. That base must not only be maintained,  it must grow by expanding  both  federal funding and industry research  partnersh ips . The new  partnership between GEA /   CEAS within UCRI is a prime example of how such a partnership can  expand our research portfolio long before eventual commercialization might be realized.

aVUniversity of  Cincinnati IEPA Application   Page  23     Case Study: The   : Spotlight on  the   Live Well Collaborative   The University of Cincinnati has a long   history   of innovative approaches to experiential learning.  This  history  dates back to  1906 , when UC launched the  first co - op program , a program that has  served as a  model concept that has been copied in 43 countries   and has impacted multiple  generations of students  in their academic pursuits and career opportunities.   UC continue s   to build highly valued experiential learning programs .  S ince 2003, professors  collaborating from industrial design, architecture, business, medicine, nursing, planning,  engineering, anthropology, journalism and other fields have run inquiry - based active learning  interdisciplinary studios, tackling wicked proble ms ranging from  cyber security , new medical  instrument design, and food insecurity, to the future of transportation and how to build future  audiences for the performing arts.    All these courses share a common goal: to teach students  how to work in high - per forming teams and to ideate and innovate collaboratively.   This approach has now been formalized into the  UC Forward Initiative .  This  exciting teaching  and learning initiative is structured around  tra ns - disciplinary collaboration and  offer s   a unique   more than 150 UC Forward courses  have  been developed   in which   students and faculty from different disciplines  work together to  analyze and design soluti ons to problems  posed by industry   or community partners.   In UC  Forward courses, the problems are tackled by using design thinking, systems thinking, scenario  planning, and other processes that take students from the beginning of inquiry to the  innovation o utcomes. Over 600 students  per  year are  now  getting UC Forward experience. At  the same time, community partners get  much needed  help   to solve their problems. This also  strengthen s   ties between the university and employers, increas es   our visibility and add s   value  in the region.    The Live Well Collaborative   ,   (LWC) one of the first UC Forward partnerships formed,  demonstrates the impact that this approach can produce.   F ounded in 2007 , it was established  as a n on - profit 501c6  that specializes in research and development of products and services for  the 50+ market place. It is a  one - of - a - kind   academic - industry innovation center where  organizations collaborate on their knowledge of the baby boomer market, which ar e over 78  million people strong with buying power in the excess of 2.3 trillion dollars. The  Live Well  Collaborative   was formed as   a   response to change the way corporations think about how they   ing population.   It is  a partnership with industry sponsors that brings together faculty and students from a range  of disciplines to work on real, industry - posed problems requiring problem analysis and design  solutions. Funding for projects can range from $ 30,000 to $100,000 per semester depending on

The Live Well Collaborative works with  global companies, such as Boeing, Procter and Gamble, Pfizer, Kraft Foods, Citi Group, General  Mills, Cincinnati Chi  - week projects,  students, faculty and experts come together to develop innovative product and service  solutions using a Design Thinking process. The Live Well Collaborative resolves IP rights issues at   project initiation ,  serves as the  interface between industry and academia and makes it easy for  companies to partner with the university   around a highly focused market .   The Live Well Collaborative is a highly  outcome - driven program.  Companies value the c reativity  and fresh perspectives students bring ,   while also benefitting   from access to UC faculty expertise  in disciplines unavailable within their organizations. In a time of decreased budgets, this public - private partnership has brought in $3 million in  new funding to support novel educational  approaches that would have been difficult without the partnership. To date, 37 projects have  been funded, 9 compan y partners   have participated, and 5 patent applications have been filed.    Since inception ,   over 500  students and 30 faculty  members  have been exposed  through this  program  to interdisciplinary thinking and shared methodology to find actionable solutions to  real world corporate and social problems. For students, working on real problems for real  employers  gives them vital skills for 21st century jobs , such as  the ability to function in high - performance teams   and   the ability to  represent their discipline or skill - set in a diverse  interdisciplinary setting . Students leave with  a tool - kit for problem solving t hat includes  brainstorming and ideation techniques and mastery of at least one innovation process from  beginning to end.     Following are several of the innovative projects developed through the Live Well Collaborative.

aV3  APLU  Innovation & Economic Prosperity Award  Submission  (IEPA)  University of Georgia   PART  1:  Process Narrative  1.1 Introduction  The University of Georgia (UGA)  convened a wo rking group on January 10,  2013 to prepare for  the IEPA  process . The  UGA P resident delegated responsibility for th e award process to the Office of Economic  Development (OED) , directed by Associate Provost for Economic Development Margaret Wagner Dahl . The working group consisted of  members  of  the  UGA  Economic Development Leadership Council (EDLC) , a university -wide team  of leaders  from multiple units  (see section 1.3) .   Support for the  IEPA  process  was also provided by the Vice Presidents for  Research,  Instruction,  and  Public  Service and Outreach  and  the UGA Survey Research Center (SRC).  The working group  decided to base its participation on  enhanc ing  the University\u2122s  commitment to three  fundamental concepts  applicable to the IEPA process  and defined as follows.   Innovation : Meaningful in novation results when a new approach is applied to an   old problem  and makes lasting and far -reaching changes in behavior.   (Kurt Nahikian  - www.spigit.com/blog/25 -definitions -of-innovation/#16 )   Economic  Engagement : Economic engagement describes collaboration between  institutions of higher education and their larger communities for the mutually beneficial   exchange of knowledge and resources i n a context of improving the economic vitality of  the city, region, state, etc.   (Adapted  from  the  Carnegie Foundation Community  Engagement definition .)   Economic Development : In higher education,  economic development involves multiple  roles:  (1) translating the university\u2122s research capacity into marketable innovations and  products;  (2) providing  technical expertise  to businesses and  governments;  (3) becoming  a catalyst for innovation a nd growth in the local area as well as the region, state, a nd nation ; and  (4) educating the future leaders of the state.  (Adapted  from Rockefeller  Institute of Government , SUNY .)

aV4   1.2  Process  Experience  1.2.1 The  IEPA  Surv ey  The UGA team  chose  to  closely  follow  the pro tocol  laid out by APLU CICEP  in order to produce data and  outcomes  derived from an objective tool.  The team implement ed both the internal and  the  external  assessment tools without changing the wording, order , or terminology . Although the IEPA process  could  potentially expose UGA to cr iticism from  some  stakeholders, th e prescribed  survey  content and  procedure were  recognized as essential to obtain meaningful direction from the process.  UGA  decided  to deploy the survey for ten  days, beginning January 23 rd  and ending February 1 st, 2013.  The SBDC  assigned  a survey specialist who worked directly with the SRC to code and debug the survey in Qualtrix .  It was  sent to  an internal cohort of  275  UGA  economic development practitioners, research faculty,  outreach faculty, students, technology com mercialization staff, incubator staff, G eorgia Research  Alliance  eminent scholars, entrepreneurial faculty, SBDC staff, and  campus  administrators (including vice  presidents,  vice and  associate provosts,  and  the  deans). From this group, we received  152  resp onses, a  55% response rate . Externally, invitations were sent to  approximately  3,000 individuals via partnerships  with the Georgia Economic Developers Association,  the  Georgia Municipal Association and  the  Association of County Commissioners of Georgia.  The leaders of each association sent an invitation  to  participate  to their entire membership. We also sent survey invitations directly to staff of the Georgia  Department of Economic Development,  the  University System of Georgia Chancellor\u2122s  Office,  UGA  incubator companies, and UGA affiliated companies.  In  less than two weeks, 599 individuals opened the  survey and 510 answered at least one question.   The survey  overall  had a  participation rate of  more than  20 percent.   1.2.2 Survey Metrics  All surveys we re completed  online  via Qualtrix  through  the UGA Survey Research Center.  External  participants were asked to consider a long list of economic development objectives and to rank both the  importance of the objective and UGA\u2122s performance in that area on a 1 -5 scale with 5 the highest.  Data  from all external participants was used to determine a cumulative average score for each objective in   terms of its importance and UGA\u2122s performance.  In addition to these two averages,  a \ufb01Gap Score\ufb02 was  also  determined  for  each objective  by calculating the difference between the  importance  of an objective  and the university\u2122s  performance .  Smaller  gap scores  were deemed  to indicat e higher success,  while  higher  gap score s were viewed as indicating  low er performance . Although  not determinative, the  gap  
p1988
aV5  scores  used in this way  pointed the  team to ward  areas of accomplishment  at UGA  and  areas of  opportunity for  improvement .  A very similar survey tool and methodology was used for the internal  survey.   As an example of the summary  data achiev ed for each object ive,  the following  figure  shows the  outcomes derived from the external  community\u2122s  response about UGA\u2122s \ufb01Regional Innovation and  Econ omic Growth Initiatives.\ufb02    Figure  1 \u0152 One  Example of  the  Survey Outcome  from  External  Pariticpants  1.2.3 Cumulative Survey Outcomes  The  summary data , which is extensive, has been preserved by the Office of Research for continuing  analysis and review.   The data identified three  \ufb01Areas of Accomplishment \ufb02: Creating an  Environment  that  Benefits  the  Public , Assisting Governmental and Business Entities , and Technology  Commercialization and Research Support Activities . All of these align with  long -term goals and  established programs of the university ,  confirm ing  their effectiveness.   More interesting for the current discussion is the survey\u2122s  identified  of  three primary areas where UGA  could  improve its p erformance : Partnering for  Economic  Growth ,  Facilitating  Interactions  between  the  Public and the  University,  and  Communicating  Econom ic  Development  Contributions .  These three were  adopted as the focus of UGA\u2122s  effort for  improvement in economic development during th e coming  yea r and form the basis of the UGA Growth/Improvement Plan discussed below   in  Section 3 . 1.2.4 Regional Stakeholder  Participat ion   \u0152 \ufb01Raising the Stakes \ufb02 Workshop   (RTS Workshop)  A stakeholder workshop  was  held March 25, 2013, titled \ufb01Raising the Stakes: Economic Development at  UGA .\ufb02 The Workshop was designed to bring leaders together to assist  with  analysis  of the I EPA survey  and to provide additional strategic input  by asking three questions : \ufb01Where  Are  We? Where  Do  We  Need to  Go?  and  What Must We Do to Get There?\ufb02    
p1989
aV6  Figure  2 \u0152 Raising the Stake  Workshop  \u0152 Program    After opening comments  by UGA\u2122s  then  Provost , Jere Morehead ,  Associate Provost for Economic  Development Margaret Wagner Dahl  addressed  the question : \ufb01Where  Are We? \ufb02 with a recap of the  survey process and  the  initial interpretation.  Then a  specially c hosen  panel  discussed  their  experience s 
p1990
aV7  with universities in terms of the  economic development  question, \ufb01Where Do We Need to Go?\ufb02   Panelists included Dr. Gregg Bevier, a recent Gates Foundation Senior Program  Officer and serial  entrepreneur ,  chosen for his industry and entrepreneuri al perspective; Gretchen Corbin, Deputy  Commissioner of the Georgia Department of Economic Development , chosen for her state leadership  perspective; Dr. Gene Merrell, Associate Vice President for Economic Development and Chief  Technology Transfer Officer a t the University of Idaho ,  chosen for his higher education experience as  well as his presence as a fellow IEPA participant; and Robert Trotter, President and CIO of ThyssenKrupp  IT Services NA ,  chosen for his experience working with UGA and Georgia Tech du ring his company\u2122s  relocation from Massachusetts to Georgia. The panel was moderated by Dean Linda Kirk Fox of UGA\u2122s  College of Family and Consumer Sciences. The panelists were encouraged to share their experiences   with UGA  and  other universities , focusing  on successful collaborations for  economic development and  how  universities  can be come  better partner s.   Figure  3 - Panelists Offer Insight on "Where  Do  We Need to  Go" After a networking break, the 130  registered  participants were  seated at tables o f eig ht for a facilitated  working  discussion . The goal was  to articulate  \ufb01What We Must Do to Get There .\ufb02 These discussions were  facilitated by two faculty from the Carl Vinson Institute  using  technology  that  allowed EDLC table leaders  at each table to  input response s to a computer which relayed all  comments  in real time to a screen at  the front of the room.  Each  table had representatives from varying groups both internal and external,  including at least one UGA administrator, one student and one facult y member at each table along with   external stakeholders from government, economic development  organizations , Chambers of Commerce,  education, business, and elected officials.

aV8   Figure 4  - An Overview  Photo  of the Facilitated Feedback Process  The  discussion s generated over 70 pages of printed responses from the RTS participants. Themes  included partnering, incentivizing faculty, industry involvement, contracting and procurement changes,  wealth creation  apart from  job creation, flexibility of curriculum, entr epreneurial thinking, and alumni  engagement.  These  themes  became  content later incorporated into the development of the  Growth/Improvement.  The workshop thus help  shape  UGA\u2122s \ufb01strategic doing\ufb02 by confirming priorities  through an objective, comprehensive process.  The changes  identified in this way  are profound in terms  of re -defining structure and  process and will discussed more fully in Section 3.

aV9  1.3 Economic Engagement Enterprise  Economic engagement  operates  throughout  UGA\u2122s  tri -partite missio n with a good deal of cooperation  among different academic units. For example ,  the  UGA Office of Economic Development  (OED)  coordinates the Economic Development Leadership Cou ncil , or EDLC , which  has  representati on from  the Carl Vinson Institute of  Government, Corporate Relations, Development, Engineering Outreach, Family  and Consumer Science s,  the  Georgia BioBusiness Center, Government Affairs, International  Partnerships, Public Service and Outreach,  the S elig Center for Economic Growth, and the Sma ll Business  Development Center (SBDC).  The EDLC  fields  all requests for assistance that come  to the OED.  The EDLC  communicates via listserv and at a monthly  informal  meeting over coffee.  One innovation has been t o assign each member at least one external s takeholder for regular interaction and engagement.   Over  time very productive informal communication links have evolved  within the group  based  on  shared  interest and collegial goodwill.  T he EDLC was a finalist for the  \ufb012012 Award of Excellence in Leadersh ip  and Collaboration \ufb02 from the University Economic Development Association. This  national  commendation  recognized the  originality ,  sustainability, replicability  of the ED LC as a me chanism to  provid e campus -wide involvem ent in economic development  that crosses  the  conventional boundaries  of  single department or  administrative  office  \ufb01silos .\ufb02  The EDLC receives support from the Vice  Presidents for  Research,  Instruction,  and  Public Service in terms of staffing, graduate assistants,  curriculum support , and leadership. Funding comes via the Provost\u2122s Office as well as the President\u2122s  Venture Fund, which allows  the use of  both state and private funds  for  our endeavors. We also receive d a small donation from an individual in 2012 to support the se efforts .  1.4 Economic Engagement Planning  1.4.1 Administrative Structural Change  Three  significant structural changes  identified with  the IEPA process  have progressed from planning to  implementation : (1)  UGA  has  opened  an  Economic Development  Office in Atlanta  to increase visibility  with the Atlanta business and government sectors ; (2) a Univer sity/Industry Liaison  has been hired ; and  (3)  the Associate Provost  for Economic Development position has been moved to  Associate Vice  President , transferring economic devel opment from a  Provost \u2122s  Office initiative to  a President\u2122s Office  commitment . The new  Associate  Vice President  position will report jointly to the Vice President  for  Research  and  the Vice President for Public Service and Outreach , reflecting the  economic development  
p1993
aV10  linkage between those two offices.  T his  change  recognize s a new  OVPR/PSO  partnership mandated by  President Morehead , partly  as a result of th e IEPA  process.    1.4.2 Revised Mission Statement  Economic development is included in UGA\u2122s  new  mission statement  which  refers to  \ufb01a commitment to  excellence in public service, economic development, and technical assistance activities designed to  address the strategic needs of the state of Georgia\ufb02 .  Similar language  appears  in UGA\u2122s Strategic  Plan  2020 which promotes  \ufb01a more uniform integration of economic development activities across units. \ufb02  Twelve out of seventeen schools and  colleges  at UGA  now identify  economic development as  important  to their mission.   1.4.3 New Curricul a \u0152 Three Exampl es Units across campus  are creating  new curricular offerings  in the field.  Three examples are t he   entrepreneurship certificate program  being planned  jointly  by  Family and Consumer Sciences and the  Terry College ; an \ufb01Entrepreneurship Bootcamp\ufb02 offered as  a Maymester Certificate Program  by  the  Franklin College ; and a  new  required course in Engineering titled , \ufb01Science and Commercialization.\ufb02     1.5 Promotion and Communication   UGA has  multiple a udiences for economic engagement messaging  that require carefully crafted,  accurate and enthusiastic communications to  encourage  their involvement in economic development  and to reward positive contributions.    Additionally , all internal stakeholders need to be given the tools  to share UGA\u2122s econo mic engagement story as  it relates to their particular area of responsibility.  In this  way sound internal communication becomes the foundation for engag ement  with external stakeholders  such as  alumni, state and local government  representatives ,  industry  and others.     In our experience,  the most compelling message is a demonstration of success.  This was the  goal of   UGA\u2122s  weeklong series of events branded as  \ufb01Thinc.  at UGA .\ufb02  By  showcas ing  UGA\u2122s support for  successful  entrepreneur ship in multiple sectors  and  by  sustaining  a focus on student  accomplishment , UGA was able to promote economic development as a viable and exciting aspect of life at the academy.   Participants included 28 companies (the \ufb01 inc. \ufb02 of the widely published program name), 22 UGA  academic  units and 5 nonprofits.   An exclusive TEDx conference  devoted to UGA \u2122s  leading thinkers , innovators and artists was completely booked out with student, faculty and community attendees.  Thinc.  also  engaged the co -founders of Singularity University, a Silicon Valley think tank  devoted to  harnessing technologies with exponential impact.  Another event was a performance by DanceFX, the  
p1994
aV11  premier professional dance company in Athens, preceded by a seminar  with its director titled , \ufb01Building  a Business by Doing What You Love.\ufb02   Other themes  explored during the week  included social  entrepreneurship, alumni  business  war stories and student engagement.   For a complete schedule  see  www.thinc.uga.edu/  .  Because  Thinc . at UGA  attracted and  energized a wide audience  during the  IEPA process of exploration with  a focus on  \ufb01local ly grown \ufb02 success stories , a n expanded  version  is being  planned for 2014.

UGA representatives led  several  of the bi -weekly  IEPA conference calls  and participated actively  to support the community  atmosphere of the  award  process. UGA has representatives on the Georgia Department of Economic Development  Advisory  Board   
p1996
aV12  (assisting the Commissioner on issues such as taxation, incentives,  and  agribusiness opportunities ), the  Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce  Executive  Board,  the  Georgia BIO  board,  and the Georgia  Chamber of Commerce. In these and many other ways, UGA  is actively engaged in promoting the  relevance and  importance of universities in economic development  on a regional, national and  international basis. Presid ent Morehead has made this a priority and requires his leadership  team  to  participate directly.  UGA has embraced best practices from Virginia Tech ( research park development  and  community engagement) , University of Washington (technology  commercialization) , University of  Idaho (community engagement ) and Purdue  University (strategic doing) . An example  of U GA  best  practices  being  embraced by other universities would be  the use at other institutions of the UGA  publication : Startups For Smartie s: A Primer  for the UGA Investigator  on  Forming a New Company Based  on Your Research Discovery .  It is b eing  adapted  for use  by Northwestern University, Georgia State  University, Georgia Regents University and a private law firm in Minneapolis , all  with  UGA\u2122s  non -pro prietary  blessing .

aV13  PART 2: Case Studies  The following case studies were previously uploaded to the CICEP website and have been included here  as representative of impacts of the CICEP process on UGA  economic engagement,  innovation  and  economic development .  2.1  UGA IAPE  Case Study  1:  The UGA Obesity Initiative  \u0152 Linking Multiple Resources   (Economic Engagement)   2.1.1 Background  Nationally, two -thirds of adults and nearly one -third of children and teens are currently overweight or  obese.  Unfortunately,  Georgia is a significant contributor to these statistics as it has one of the highest  rates of obesity and is one of only seven states to have doubled its rate of obesity in the past 15 years.    Specifically, one of every three adults in Georgia is obese an d another 37 percent of Georgia adults are  overweight .  New projections indicate that by 2030, the rate of obesity in Georgia will increase to nearly  54%.   The combined rate of overweight and obesity in adults in Georgia exceeds 65 percent.  Ten to  fifteen  percent of Georgians have a disability, and they are 60% more likely to be obese than non -disabled Georgians.  Forty percent of Georgia children are overweight or obese .  The steady increase in  the number of overweight infants is a major cause for alarm,  as obese children have an 80 percent  probability of being obese when they become adults.   For Georgia, this translates into a projected cost of  $4.43 billion for 2013 in direct health care costs and lost productivity from disease, disability, and death  \u0152 the equivalent of 115% of Georgia\u2122s total healthcare budget for 2013.   The University of Georgia launched a major campus -wide initiative in June 2011 to help the state  address its growing epidemic of childhood and adult obesity.  As Georgia\u2122s land -grant uni versity, UGA is  able to bring together  diverse and extensive obesity -related research activities, instruction, and public  service and outreach components to address this multi -faceted problem.  The initiative is developing  obesity education, prevention and  treatment programs that Georgia communities, employers, and  healthcare providers can implement.    More than 150 UGA faculty members are active in collaborative teams focused on areas ranging from  basic research on obesity, metabolism, genetics and disease  to the development of pharmaceuticals,  weight management interventions, gaming and mobile technologies for health messaging and  
p1998
aV14  innovative after -school exercise programs.  In order to encourage development of new collaborative  research projects, UGA has a llocated $200,000 to fund research proposals that will generate preliminary  data for larger federal and foundation grants.  Eight innovative projects have been funded to date. In   addition to these in -house funded projects, at least 50 new grant proposals h ave been submitted to  federal and foundation granting agencies  by UGA faculty  as a result of new ideas and collaborations  stimulated by the Obesity Initiative.  New faculty positions have also been funded to recruit top research and policy academics to UGA.   These positions will be in the Department of Health Policy and Management of the College of Public   Health, the Department of Food and Nutrition in the College of Family  and  Consumer Sciences, and  in  the Departments of Genetics and Biochemistry and Molecu lar Biology.  A novel instruction al component is being developed at both the undergraduate and graduate levels that  will include interdisciplinary certificate programs, areas of emphasis and continuing education. Courses   are being planned in areas such as S ervice Learning for Obesity Interventions in Communities, Designing   Environments for Prevention and Management of Obesity, Functional Fitness, Disability, the   Environment and Obesity, Training and Uses of Animals for Owner Obesity Therapies, and others.  UGA is also working to improve its own employees\u2122 health and reduce health care costs related to  obesity. On campus, new health and wellness programs for faculty and staff are being explored. Public  health policy and workplace health experts also are identif ying ways to encourage improved nutrition  and physical activity among employees, their dependents and retirees of the 35 University System of  Georgia colleges and universities.    2.1.2  UGA as  a Catalyst for  Corporat e/Government /Communit y Partnerships  One of the key components of the Obesity Initiative is community engagement with academic and public   service  faculty. As a land grant university, UGA develops and implements community programs across  the state. Strong ties to Georgia communities allow impl ementation of translational research projects to   demonstrate real -world effectiveness, provide service learning opportunities for our students, and  capitalize on  lessons learned for classroom applications.   Facilitating training opportunities for Public He alth officials is an important role the Obesity Initiative  seeks to accomplish. Brenda Fitzgerald , Commissioner of Public Health ,   came to UGA to learn more  about the Obesity Initiative. During discussions with faculty from the College of Public Health,  the 
p1999
aV15  College of Education, and the College of Family and Consumer Sciences, the Georgia Public Health  Training Center at UGA was tapped to provide services for the Governor\u2122s Childhood Obesity Strategic   Planning team. The Center has also provided on -line trai ning for the prevention of childhood obesity for  public health professionals and public school educators across the state.  A number of community -oriented projects by Obesity Initiative members are currently ongoing,  including a project in Columbus -Muscogee  County involving local government and  UGA\u2122s Fanning  Institute  to address childhood obesity in the community, and one in Colquitt County elementary schools,  which is the result of a partnership between YMCA -after  school programs, UGA\u2122s Cooperative Extension  Service and  UGA\u2122s Archway Program . 2.1.3 Major Funding from Coca -Cola  After a visit to UGA by Dr. Rhona  Applebaum , Vice President and Chief Scientific and Regulatory Officer  at The Coca -Cola Company, to learn about the Obesity Initiative, members of the Obesity Initiative Team  were invited to Coca -Cola\u2122s headquarters to discuss partnerships with the company. As a res ult of the  University\u2122s capacity to address the obesity problem in Georgia,  the Coca -Cola  Company  has committed  major funding   to wor k with UGA to promote  \ufb01Walk Georgia \ufb02 through its sponsorships of programs and  events across Georgia and through  the Coca -Cola Foundation\u2122s  financial support  for the  Walk Georgia  program.   The amount has not yet been formally announced but will likely excee d one million dollars  over the next few years.  The University of Georgia Cooperative Extension Service provides the support and infrastructure for  Walk Georgia , but its  strength is connecting University faculty w ith communities.  Coca -Cola  joined the  effort  in recognition that  UGA \u2122s  cross -disciplinary  Obesity Initiative  had the  capacity  to  achieve  significant  and  positive health impacts .  In addition , UGA has  been  able to  use the Coca -Cola  commitment to involve other  partner s as  new private sector allies  helping  to increase  UGA\u2122s  statewide  impact  in the field of obesity .

aV17  2.2 UGA IEPA  Cas e Study 2 :  VentureLab  \u0152 Taking Ideas to the Marketplace     (Innovation)    2.2.1 The Georgia Research Alliance  and VentureLab  The Georgia Research Alliance (GRA) was established in 1990 to enable the expansion of technology -based economic development throughout the state. GRA is a n independent, privately funded  organization that manages public investments in research infrastructure, academic talent and  commercialization. GRA\u2122s commercialization role  involves a nurturing  partnership with the six major  research universities  in the st ate: the University of Georgia, Georgia Tech University, Georgia Regents  University, Georgia State University, Emory University, and Clark Atlanta University.  GRA  serves as the  overarching clearinghouse, champion, and seed fund ing source  for commercially  viable research  at  these institutions  as well as accelerating start -ups derived from  faculty  research. GRA accomplishes this  task by recruiting academic talent with a focus on economic development through their  Eminent  Scholars program  and via the GRA  VentureLab program which provides grants for technology validation  and startup company acceleration.  GRA\u2122s VentureLab  program  serves as an essential tool to shepherd  biotechnology and life  sciences  discoveries made at Georgia\u2122s research universities to the marketplace. Started in 2002, VentureLab   provides access to management and technical expertise, prototype and proof of concept funding, and  infrastructure to early stage start -ups develope d from University -based research. After initial vetting of  an idea, funding proposals are submitted through a University\u2122s VentureLab representative.  Representatives from GRA and each member institution gather on a quarterly basis to review   submissions and  collectively provide recommendations to GRA management for funding awards using a  progressive, three -tiered structure. External investors, industry experts, and entrepreneurs serve as  advisors as well as independent reviewers. Subject to milestone complet ion and external review,  companies can apply for further funds.  Maximum fun ding available per project/company  is $150,000 in  grants (Phases 1 and 2), $250,000 in loans (Phase 3) provided directly to the company . Access to a  captive venture capital fund  is  available  where appropriate (Phase 4). Subsequent to stage one funding,  companies are incubated at their respective universit ies .    
p2002
aV18  2.2.2  VentureLab  Comes to  the UGA  Campus  In 2002, the University of Georgia (UGA) assisted GRA with piloting the first biotechnology VentureLab  projects. This resulted in GRA expanding its program  to  UGA , formally establishing  a UGA VentureLab  program on the UGA  campus . UGA  VentureLab  is ba sed within the Georgia BioBusiness Center  (GBBC)  which is the university\u2122s  biotechnology business incubator . Its trio  of on -campus buildings combin es office and laboratory space  to ho use  a vibrant and fertile environment  that intermixes  entrepreneurs hip , research, and  instruction. T he goal of UGA VentureLab is to mitigate risk early , in  order to assist companies to become \ufb01fundable\ufb02 and ultimately be sustainable residents of the incuba tor  and the regional economy . UGA\u2122s VentureLab program provides UGA faculty with the necessary funding  to assess feasibility, intellectual property  value , prototyping, proof  of concept, business planning and  ultimately market viability while giving them real -world experience with early stage technology  development. Projects are derived from University of Georgia owned intellectual property and  the  resulting start -up companies  are committed to forming and growing in the state of Georgia. A  distinguishing feature of VentureLab is providing funding at the earliest developmental phases  \u0152 when  failure is  otherwise  more apt to occur. Typically Phase 1 and 2 funding triggers successf ul Small Business  Innovation Research (SBIR) funding, which is now a primary method for crossing the chasm to becoming  a real company.   Figure 8 1: The three phases of Georgia VentureLab company development  
p2003
aV19   Figure  92: The flow of  GRA  funding and information in VentureLab  In FY 2012, the UGA VentureL ab received $281,300 in GRA funding for  nine projects over nine separate  awards . Over the Lab\u2122s lifetime, over $2 million in GRA funding has been secured. A total of 22  companies have been born  via  UGA\u2122s VentureLab . Additionally, the Lab supports an entrepreneurial  environment on campus by hosting workshops and seminars. These activities have the added benefit of  cultivating a vibrant atmosphere  that attracts  future UGA VentureLab participants.  2.2.3  Ventur eLab  EXAM PLE  - When  An  Idea  Takes  Root and  Grows  What if a student learned a scientific concept not by memorizing a section of a textbook but by engaging  with the subject using 3 -D video gaming technology to interact and thus truly grasp and retain the  material?  As the result of a five -year NIH study into classroom science education conducted through UGA\u2122s College  of Veterinary Medicine, the idea for this pioneering means of science education  emerged as a new   potential product  in 2010  at t he  company  Interactive Science s in 3D (IS3D ) which  was started by UGA  faculty.  Among IS3D\u2122s offerings is the game  OsyOsmosis  that enables s tudents  to  use their understanding of the  process of osmosis to navigate  a fictional  single -celled organism \ufb01Osy\ufb02 through her environment,  collecting points along the way. In another application, students assume the role of a veterinarian tasked   with diagnosing  Clark  the Calf  who is having persistent seizures. Students can \ufb01fly -in\ufb02 to Clark\u2122s body  
p2004
aV20  where they observe what happens in the brain when seizures are brought on by an ionic imbalance.  By  taking the same measurements that might be available to a veterinarian,  students can compare Clarke\u2122s   data to baseline readings, generate a hypothesis, make a diagnosis, and administer treatment making a   \ufb01real world\ufb02 application of the scientific method.  The high quality graphics and creative scenarios   engage the students who  must master the scientific concept of osmosis in order to \ufb01win\ufb02 the game and  save Clarke.  More  about  Clark the Calf  is available at  http://www.redandblack.com/news/calf -in-distress -teaches -kids -about -science/article_64664c4a -2f81 -11e2 -b9d7 -001a4bcf6878.html .  Through the assistance and support of UGA\u2122s VentureLab, IS3D was able to explore the requirements to   develop  and commercialize their idea and then secure seed funding from GRA that allowed them to  further develop their concept, hire subject matter experts, and fine -tune a prototype. This positioned  them to receive further funding from the National Institute s of H ealth (NIH)  with an  SBIR  grant.   Over a two -year period, IS3D received $150,000 in funds from GRA  and brought a significant return to  Georgia on this investment.  As a result of  GRA\u2122s support,  10 high ly  skilled jobs were created, and $3  million in federal f unds were brought into Georgia  for subsequent grant funded research by UGA  participants and me mbers of the  local Athens community.  Currently in the Lab\u2122s second developmental  phase, IS3D is working on developing a full suite of software for integration  into  biology curricul a.

aV22   2.3  UGA IEPA Case Study 3 :  Redevelopment Plan  Prop osal for  the  Altama  Community  Transformation District  (ACT)  in Brunswick -Glynn County    (Economic Development)   2.3.1  The UGA  Archway  Partnership  The Archway Partnership  concept began in 2005 as a simple question: \ufb01How do we \u0152the University of  Georgia \u0152improve  our capacity to respond to Georgia\u2122s community and economic development needs ?\ufb02 What emerged was a new way to help Georgia communities solve problems by increasing community  access to the full resources of UGA. By communities driving the identification of needs through  partnership participation, UGA resources could be brought to bear  efficiently and expeditiously.   This process begins with the development of an  Executive  Committee of community leaders who help  guide the proces ses  of the partnership.  Participants include c ommunity members from local  governments, businesses, health authorities, school boards,  Chambers of  Commerce, development  authorities and local education institutions . Steering Committees are made up of other community  stakeholders willing to commit time a nd energy to developing and prioritizing community issues.   Interested residents are recruited for Issue Work Groups,  usually  chaired by Steering Committee  members,  and together they  focus on developing strategies to address  real  issues  in the community .   Today the Archway Partnership is a formal unit of the University of Georgia\u2122s Office of the Vice President  for Public Service and Outreach (PSO). PSO includes eight units providing diverse services to   communities across Georgia to solve real world public pr oblems. PSO also engages academic faculty and   students in service work from continuing education, small business development assistance, marine   extension, service learning, economic development capacity building, and leadership training. Academic   faculty a nd students participate in many of these services. The Archway program represents a unique  community driven model and has received national attention.  2.3.2  Origins of  the  Brunswick -Glynn County Archway Partnership  The Brunswick -Glynn County Archway Partnership was established July 1, 2008, bringing together  int o a Growth Task Force (GTF) th at includes local l eaders  concerned with  high priority community needs. The  City of Brunswick, Glynn County Board of Commissione rs, Glynn County Board of Education, Brunswick -Golden Isles Chamber of Commerce, Brunswick -Glynn County Development Authority, Southeast  Georgia Health System, and  the  College of Coastal Georgia, as well as citizen groups, business interests,  
p2009
aV23  and non -profi t organizations, are all  GTF  represent atives  at the Archway discussion table. As an Archway  Partnership community, Brunswick -Glynn County has seamless access to the full array of resources of  the University of Georgia.   The Brunswick -Glynn County / Archway  Growth Task Force (GTF) was established to address growth  issues and explore redevelopment opportunities in the Altama community.  Representatives of 14 local   and regional planning agencies were engaged in the process.  The  GTF has identified a 1,600 -acre  property along  Altama  Avenue known as the  Altama  Community Transformation District  (ACT) .  The  main campuses for the College of Coastal Georgia and the Southeast Georgia Health System, the site for   Brunswick\u2122s new High School, and a variety of other land us es are all located within the ACT. The  prospects of future population growth, the expansion plans of the College of Coastal Georgia, Southeast   Georgia Health System,  the  Glynn County Board of Education, and the interests of business and property  owners  all have a significant interest in the creation of  a thriving community  in a  revitaliz ed  Altama  Avenue corridor and  in the  surrounding areas.    2.3.3  The Archway Process  During fall 2010, a group of UGA PSO faculty met with  the  GTF  members  to examine how PSO might  contribute to GTF\u2122s efforts as a whole, as well as  to  establish mechanisms for engaging specific areas of  PSO expertise. Focusing on three specific areas, PSO worked directly with GTF in creating a   redevelopment plan for the  Altama  Community Transformation District  that focused on three specific  needs :  redevelopment/revitalization,  stakeholder engagement, and implementation mechanisms.  Redevelopment/Revitalization  PSO completed four primary elements of redevelopment/revita lization  for the ACT District:  (1)  Corridor Redesign :  At the center of ACT is the  Altama  Avenue corridor. Elements of this portion of  the redevelopment plan included: Land uses, streetscape design, architectural building design, site   design standards, historic pre servation, green space/recreation areas, signage, lighting, branding,  planning tools such as overlay zoning districts, and emergency preparedness.  Additionally, branding  elements were discussed which could be used throughout the process, in and around the  ACT district,  and with various partners.   (2)  Housing Assessment : Understanding the existing housing environment  as  better equipped  for  commercial interactio ns , and  knowing that  despite  the community\u2122s governing  inf luence on housing  
p2010
aV24  and GTF in the develo pment of design guidelines, incentives and policies. Elements of this portion  included: documentation of existing housing stock, design elements, and demographics.   (3)  Transportation/Road Design : Elements of this portion of the plan included right -of-way design.   (4)  Economic Development : In order to ensure the area\u2122s complete enhancement, economic  development issues addressed a market analysis and an over/under supply study.  Additionally, local  entities collaborated to establish a defined work plan for attracting prospects, areas, and specific goals.    Stakeholder Engagement  It was critical to have buy -in from the general public and governing bodies at all levels of planning  throughout the entire  process. Each of the aforementioned areas of the redevelopment plan required  extensive stakeholder input and engagement from neighborhood groups, residents, elected and   appointed government officials, GTF planners, business owners, students, college and K -12 administrators. Methods used throughout the process included: personal interviews, focus groups, town   hall meetings, informal conversations, and the input and guidance garnered from the Design Steering   Committee (appointed local citizens to guide the d esign process on a daily basis).  Implementation Mechanisms and Training  Critical to the ACT redevelopment plan were mechanisms for successful implementation and training of   elected/appointed officials and other stakeholders of those mechanisms. Financing  options, local  financial institutions/programs, streamlined permitting process es, and training were created as part of  PSO\u2122s work to assist the local community with implementation of the ACT redevelopment plan.

aV25   Figure 11  Altama  Design Plan Process   2.3.4  Impact to Date  The plan provides Brunswick and Glynn County with a road map for redevelopment focusing on four key  elements: corridor redesign overlay district (i.e., streetscape, land -use, design standards, etc.);  transportation (i.e., right of way, alternative choices, etc.); housing (i.e., uses, condition, historical  significance, etc .); and economic development (e.g., opportunities for business expansion and  recruitment). The GTF and local governments have adopte d the plan and are using it to guide the  redevelopment of this critical corridor that serves as a primary gateway and significant business  thoroughfare. This process and application has been viewed as a critical success to the redevelopment of   this importa nt sector of the State.

aV28  PART 3:   Growth/Improvement Plan  Based on the outcome of its IEPA survey process, UGA identified  three areas of opportunity  for  improvement that have become the basis for the Growth/Improvement plan.  3.1 Areas of Opportunity  for Improvement  3.1.1  Partnering for Economic Growth  UGA  has an oppo rtunity to engage more in partnerships for economic growth.  UGA  internal  respondents believe that it is important for the university to be a better partner with the community  and the region.  Internal respondents feel  UGA  should do a better job of collabor ating within the  university. For example, on the question \ufb01Supporting and strengthening university -community  partnerships, including those involving applied research and the use of academic facilities by industry,\ufb02   68.7% of internal respondents felt that t his was very important but only 7.8% felt that UGA was  performing in a superior fashion.   Possible enhancements include the areas of curriculum & course  flexibility, helping to retain and grow existing businesses , and public /private partnerships to catalyz e innovation.   Figure 1 4 \u0152 Excerpt from the internal assessment
p2014
aV29  During  the  RTS  Workshop , internal participants shared  concerns about   (1) streamlining the contract and  approval process for contracting with external partners;   (2) creating stronger  internal connections to  foster collaboration and innovation; and  (3) focusing on curriculum and course flexibility including  expansion of online offerings.  We learned from this interaction that external  stakeholders from  business, industry, government, and  education want to interact more closely with UGA in areas such as  talent development, business retention and recruitment, and professional training. For example, on the  topic of  \ufb01Partnering with community members to define public and private investments t hat catalyze  economic and innovative growth ,\ufb02 91.8% of respondents thought this was important or very important  but only 14.3% rated UGA\u2122s performance as excellent. External concerns identified were:  (1) aligning  curricular content to match current industr y-specific needs ,  (2) partnering with government (federal,  state, local) to retain and grow existing businesses,  (3) ensuring  that  career  and  recruiting services  partner with regional businesses and highlight professional opportunities in the region  and  (4) connecting economic actors across organizational boundaries to facilitate collaborations that otherwise  might not occur.

p2015
aV30  3.1.2  Facilitating  Interactions  Between the  Public and UGA   Internal  survey  respondents identified the importance of creating a more open and transparent  relationship with the public as well as simplifying business interactions and other engagement  opportunities. For example, on the  topic  \ufb01Recognizing and promulgat ing policies and processes that  facilitate effective university -community interaction\ufb02  more than  95% of respondents felt this was either  important or very important but only 6.3% said UGA was performing in a superior manner. During  the   RTS  Workshop , intern al participants also shared more details about their concerns in this area. Some of  the suggestions were  (1) making it easier for faculty to learn about ways to interact with the community  personally and professionally;  (2) increasing the focus on industry  contracts , including  those  involving  faculty directly with industry ; (3)  providing the necessary infrastructure in the research office to support  this type of faculty engagement and  (4) integrat ing Public Service and Outreach faculty  more directly  with  traditional academic faculty.  Externally,  respondents identified the importance of UGA resources in supporting economic  development and engagement  initiatives  locally, regionally and statewide. Respondents want to know  how to quickly  access resources, services, and talent at UGA. For example, on the  topic of  \ufb01Developing  structures and networks to facilitate interactions among key university personnel and the region\u2122s major   economic actors,\ufb02 87.2 % of respondents rated this activity imp ortant or very important but only 12.6%  rated UGA\u2122s performance as excellent. During  the  RTS  workshop , external stakeholders  offered  some  major  suggestions about  facilitating these interactions, including:  (1) creating a stronger presence in  Atlanta;  (2) providing a one -stop website and office as a clearinghouse for resources;  (3) aligning  curriculum with market needs; and  (4) communicating with external partners in a way they can  understand  by using \ufb01their\ufb02 language  too,  not  just  UGA\u2122s language.     
p2016
aV31   Figur e 16 - Feedback from  the  Raising the Stakes Workshop  3.1.3  Communicating  Economic  Development  Contributions  The University of Georgia has  played an important role  in contributing to the region\u2122s economic  development activities . However, the University has  not effectively communicated these successes to  internal and external stakeholders.   As noted in the many IEPA community calls and discussions, this is a  national issue that impacts all institutions. Internally, respondents identified the need to communica te  to internal and external stakeholders about economic engagement more effectively and to engage all  communications offices across campus in telling stories about innovation and economic engagement.   For example, on the  topic of  \ufb01Developing communications  strategies that highlight the success stories  across the institution and  that  utilize all avenues of dissemination, including new media tools,\ufb02  more  than 90 % of respondents listed this activity as important or very important but only 8.3% thought UGA  was p erforming in a superior fashion.   Some themes that came from  the  RTS  Workshop  in regard to  these internal concerns included:  (1) decentraliz ing  communication distribution;  (2) start ing a  weekly  newsletter, brownbag luncheons, and/or an annual event that re wards successful efforts in innovation  and economic development; and  (3) recogniz ing  the importan ce  of communicating output, outcomes,  and impact  in this field .  "Re -evaluate the  contracts and grants  so that industry and  university time lines  match."  "Align our  curriculum with  market needs."  "Make it easier to  connect with the  university  \u0152 improve  response time and  general  responsiveness."  
p2017
aV32  External respondents were clearly asking for more communication both in type and scope  \u0152 stori es,  visits, lectures, and opportunities to visit campus were common examples. However, the external  stakeholders also clearly want UGA to think differently about the methods and manner of the   communication activities focused to ward  the external community. For example, on the  topic of  \ufb01Broadly  disseminating information about university/community collaborations\ufb02  more than  95% thought this was  important or very important while only  about  12% rated UGA\u2122s performance as excellent. During  the  RTS  Workshop , external stakeholders shared some specific thoughts related to improving these  communication efforts, including:  (1) the need for UGA to better speak the language of non -academics,  especially  with  business and industry;  (2)  provid ing  com munication training for university employees so   they can  convey their economic development commitments   effectively;  (3) target ing  stories to multiple  audiences using different methods of dissemination; and  (4) consider ing the use of  external consultants  and contractors  to  develop and disseminat e marketing materials and other university publications  including magazines, newsletters and commercials.  Communication priorities expressed in the input  from stakeholders who participated in the survey process and  RTS workshop can be gauged from the   following word cloud figure.   Figure  17 - Word  Cloud of  Participant Re sponses  Regarding  Communications  at the  RTS  Workshop  The survey process,  the  RTS Workshop and ongoing conversations with the EDLC provided a  large bo dy of suggestions , but a n essential  element in the process was the  way  data analysis  allowed us  to  focus on  three  goals  for improvement  as we organized  the following plan.

aV35  3.3 Conclusion:  Where  Are  We? W here  Do  We Need to Go ? What Must  We Do to Get There ? These three  questions  from our Raising the Stakes Workshop  discussed in S ection 1. 2.4 can serve as a  schema for  summarizing the IEPA project that has been underway  at the University of  Georgia for the  past year.    Where Are  We?    UGA comes from a very definite place historically with a  particular kind of institutional culture that has  evolved  with th e fundamental idea that a state -funded  institution  should  have the social responsibility  to  improv e the lives and well -being of all  the state\u2122s  citizens . This commitment dates well before the  Mor rill Act which created the main land -grant universities in th e US . In Georgia, the idea of institutional  responsibility dates  to colonial times and Georgia\u2122s founder, social reformer James Oglethorpe.   While  the original land -grant mission  was focused on  sharing expertise in agriculture , th e translatable  knowledge -base of the institution has grown considerably in the natural sciences, engineering, the social  sciences and many other directions.  More than two decades ago, people additionally realized clearly  that the land -grant mission in the twent y-first century woul d involve an increasing commitment to  human health.  We are in fact all of these directions at once, and it can be daunting and confusing to   contemplate how to shape them into direct, practical benefits for the people of Georgia and beyond.    Where  Do We Need to Go?    You can sometimes get a look into the future by climbing a different platform with a different   perspective.  If you are lucky, you might recognize a new pathway through  and beyond  the complex  historical  mixture  of what you already know about y ourself.  APLU  CICEP  IEPA i s that kind of platform.    During the year\u2122s  IEPA activities , including shared experiences with other  institutions and  organizations,  we have learned many useful lessons  about our institutional identity .  We have also been able to  experiment with  both  new departures and  with  doing a more thorough job of assessing innovations we  already ha d in place.    What  Must We Do to Get There?  One year of strategic thinking,  program  development,  data collection, data  analysis and wide  engagement with stakeholders  cannot provide enough information and context to establish a   permanent economic development strategy. N o matter how complete and inclusive  our  discourse  has  been this year , no matter how imaginative and engag ing the  individual  events  have turned out ,  one year  of discovery  is too time -bound a foundation to transform  an institution as diverse and committed as the  University of Georgia  has been  for two centuries in  economic development .  However, there  has been  
p2024
aV36  wide recognition  among  the economic development leadership  at UGA of a  need to step up the  university\u2122s game, and the IEPA process provided not only the appropriate context but also a well -reasoned game  plan for  conducting  a transformative  economic developm ent assessment  that has  identified  commitments to  action  that need to be made.   The real test now will be continuity,  continuation of the good faith effort underway .

aVOur mission and vision call us to be the engines of economic and social growth for our   communities.     We do this not only by  adding to the workforce, but also by engaging in  research and discovery.  Dr. Renu Khator, President, University of Houston, 2012 .     Under   the  leadership   of President Khator ,  ,  the University of Houston (UH)  has transitioned from a  predominantly commuter - based,  non - residential  university  to  a rapidly expanding, residential  institution   fast becoming one of the leading  public  academic and research institutions   in  the nation.     Since 2008,  UH  has  virtually  tripled   the  residential student population, more than doubled research expenditures   and  become recognized as a  Tier One  Research Institution by  both  the  Carnegie Foundation and the  State of Texas . Moreover, UH  is home to 13 national academy  faculty  members,   10 ac ademic programs   ranked  in the top 50  nationally in the top 50  nationally   ranked programs  in  their discipline ,  and   ranked  14 th   of all public universities for income generated by patent r oyalties , while  at the same time  being  recognized   as one of the most ethnically diverse campuses in the nation.  A focus on student success,  research excellence ,  innovation   and entrepreneurship   has been the cornerstone of     rapid  progress  towards national prominence. In this context,  UH  assembled a tea m in November 2013  that was  tasked  with preparing   an application to APLU for consideration as an Innovation and Economic Prosperity   (IEP)   University designee   to reflect    to serve and impact its   local and regional  communities .    Central themes in this application   are defined  as follows:   Innovation:    (revolutionary), but also, the renewal or change of something already in existence  (evolutionary).   Economic Eng agement:    education and their larger communities for the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and     Economic Prosperity:   The accumulation   (or e nhancement?)   of capital from multiple sources,  e.g. , financial, human and social.     B.   PROCESS EXPERIENCE     It is important to note that  after studying the  2014  IEP process guidelines  the  UH  team  decided   to  conduct the   IEP self - study process  in a manner consist ent with  the  existing  goals  of  the   university

aV  4     strategic plan .  This  framework   was  created  in 2010  after   a  university - wide  planning  process which  identified three key s   areas : 1) ,    namely  energy ; 2) ,   healthcare ;    and  3)  the arts, around which the  cam pus  community   and external stakeholders    should be built .  A central tenet of this  plan was   the  recognition  by  UH  that achieving   national prominence  was inexorably linked to meeting  the  educational/research/work - force development needs  of  its  local and regional communities.     After discussions with the CICEP IEP Working Group ,   the  IEP  self - study  process   was initiated  in  December 2013  by producing a Qualtrics - based survey  incorporating the CICEP assessment tools  with a  brief video introduction   fr om President Khator  ( http://youtu.be/b7dw - NYuq50 ) .  The survey was  distributed   to industry   and business leaders   identified by  the   Advisory Boards and the UH Alumni Organizat ion ,  as well as 27 local Chamber of Commerce offices .  The  survey was distributed to approximately 120 external stakeholders ( 49   viewed the survey)   with o ver half  self - identify ing   as business owners/entrepreneurs and senior executives , of which  and  2 8 responded by  completing the survey for a  19 % response rate ;   o ver half self - identifi ed   as business  owner s/entrepreneurs and senior   executives . The average time to complete the survey was 23 minutes.     In a similar manner, the CICEP tool for internal assess ment was   distributed   in a Qualtrics - based survey  format   to members of the  internal  UH community, including  administrators , faculty and staff from a  cross - section of departments   and campus leadership groups .  The survey was distributed to  167  internal  stakeholders  (57   viewed the survey) and 48  responded by completing the survey for a  34%   response  rate.   The average time to complete the survey was 15 minutes.   In addition, an analysis of UH performance using CICEP metrics was conducted by the UH R esearch  Information Center  located in  DOR  and includes data from the previous  five   fiscal years   (Appendix 1) .    C.   THE ECONOMIC ENGAGEMENT ENTERPRISE     Since its foundation in 1927 ,   UH   has  had  a consistent policy of economic engagement with  local  industries   and   businesses .   More recently , economic engagement ha s ve   aligned with three core  competencies   at UH : 1) ,  namely    e e nergy ; 2) ,   healthcare and  3)  the arts .    In keeping with best practices of other Universities, UH utilize s   the expertise of business and community  leaders   to   define   the needs of  industry and  the surrounding community   by maintaining a two -   way  dialogue   through a variety of advisory boards   (some examples listed below) .

aVengagement efforts.  For example, S   in the energy sector  UH created uch efforts include :   formation of    petroleum engineering, subsea engineering   and  construction   management   programs   at both  undergraduate and graduate levels   in the   energy sector ;   . In the healthcare sector, UH created  fast - track  academic programs in medicine and nursing with professional development programs in athletic training  and human space flig ht operations   in the healthcare sector ;   and . In the arts   sector , UH created   a  graduate program in Arts Leadership focused on entrepreneurship in  arts and entertainment the arts  sector .    T hese new programs   are  examples  of the  critical  role played by external  stakeholder  input   relative to  the   implementation   of   emerging   initiatives at UH .  When  the UH  Presidential  Energy   Advisory Board  suggested the creation of a petroleum engineering program   to address  critical shortages in  the  regional  o il and gas industry   work - force , UH responded   by raising over $6M to fund new infrastructure and  recruit industry experts to develop the curriculum .   The Business - Higher Education Forum highlighted  this  activity   exemplary  that  the achievemen t  a a  a model of how business and higher  education can collaborate to meet workforce needs.    Similarly, a   gra d ua te program in human space  exploration sciences was formed  after   calls from  local industry  and government officials   to  educate  workers   for   critical shortages in the   niche  regional  work - force supporting  manned space flight.  O n - line  surveys / focus groups  with  external stakeholders , coupled with curriculum development  with   NASA  personnel   ultimately led to  formation of  a  unique program  that  combi n es   technical  and  project  management   training   in human space flight operations .   A final example of this collaborative approach   was is   the  formation   of  the UH Center for Arts Leadership , with   the  establishment of an  MA Arts  Leadership   program.   This   initiative   w as   in response to calls from   the   to  encourage innovation and entrepreneurship in the arts sector  and   develop  new leadership nation - wide.   All  of these examples  show a close partnership between  UH,  industry leaders   and the   entrepreneurial  community   in shaping programs responsive to regional needs in a manner that is agile and flexible.     The  Office of Intellectual Property Management (OIPM) in the  Division of Research (DOR)   at UH   functions as the epicenter for economic enga gement as it relates to   managing    creation of  intellectual  property (IP) , technology transfer and commercialization , entrepreneurship training  for   students and  faculty   and securing investment from  the  private sectors for economic development and growth.    In its  role as a catalyst for promoting  such activities , DOR/OIPM has initiated  various  internal programs   designed to  recognize faculty inventors   and   accelerate  i nnovation/ entrepreneurship   by   adopting best  practices from other institutions   and the  start - up   community  while  leveraging various existing academic  and research programs .    Some notable  internal programs   developed   by DOR/OIPM are  listed below .   F urther detail   is provided   in  S ection   2   and  supporting graphs may be found in   Appendix 2 .

This   is  evidenced    advice   from the UH  Presidential  Energy Advisory Board  to develop coordinated  academic, research and work - force development  program s   in both traditional  and renewable energy sector s .  In  2013 ,    UH appointed a  Chief Energy Officer   responsible for  interfac ing  with  external stakeholders , coordinating all activities in the energy sector and attracting additional  economic engagement opportunities  for   UH in this rapidly expanding sector of the U S economy.

aV    Center (TMC), the largest medical treatment and education complex in the world of which UH is a full  institutional member.    In 2012, TMC ha d   a combined operating budget of $15 billion   with   $3.4 billion  research funding and employ ed s   106,000 total personnel including 5 , 700 researchers.   UH plans to  replicate the success of  its energy initiatives   by creating similar  infrastructure focused   on healthcare  related education, workforce development and entrepreneurship.  On the recommendation of a  presidential taskforce ,   the UH Health Sciences Center (UH - HSC)   was  established   in 2013 and   a  Chief  Health Officer   was appointed   shortly thereafter  to c oordinate  operations. The UH - HSC is  creating   new  academic programs aimed  at  meeting   work - force deficits  already identified by external stake - holders  in  a number of  primary care fields   (i.e.  nursing, physical  and occupational  therapy ,  athletic   training ,  physician and physician   assistants ) .  UH - HSC   will also  be the home of  expanded programs in optometry,  pharmacy, social work ,    and  psychology , nutrition and speech therapy   already delivering  clinical care  to  Greater Houston area   residents .  These academic prog rams / cl inical  facilities will provide   not only   the  physical  infrastructure  in which  to educate and train  the next generation of  primary care professionals,  but also  to  provide   expanded primary  care services   for Houston and the surrounding region .   A similar approach  under pins   the   develop ment of   the UH Arts Initiative   were  UH   is  currently  seeking to  appoint a   Chief Arts Officer   who will be responsible for interfacing with external stakeholders   and   coordinating all activities  centered on the  local  art s industry . Remarkably, this is a very strong segment  of the regional economic enterprise, which independently attracts nearly 11 million people and  generates $625 million in economic activity each year in Houston.     E.   PROMOTION AND COMMUNICATION     
p2039
aV  9     It  is an  enormous   challenge  t o   communicat e   and  mak e   meaningful connections with people in the  fourth most populous city (with the largest geographic metro area) in the  US . Houston is regarded by   metropolitan area in the  US . Not  surprisingly ,  Forbes ranks UH the second most diverse campus in the  country . UH is constantly striving  to assure that     messag es ing   are is   cogent and universal in meaning across  a  broad  cultural  spectrum.    Radio remains a rel evant and viable communication medium today .  KUHF - FM Houston is helping to  inspire  educators,    adcast 5 days  per week in Houston and by over thirty National Public Radio affiliates  across   the US. Over 2900  episodes have aired since the program began in 1988, with each episode telling the story of our culture  and the influence of   human creativity.   In   1953, KUHT began broadcasting as the first public television station in the US. According to the   KUHT has served as a model and example for other educational  television stations and systems throughout the country  K UHT  remains a powerful vehicle for  communicating with  UH constituents   and provides an immense public service in the process.   One  example  relevant to this application  is a series of one -   st by KUHT that provide s   information on specific UH   programs , including   items in the  energy, innovation and entrepreneur ship   fields.   In 2013, UH became a   corporate sponsor of  X conomy Texas, a Houston - based technology innovation  magazine . This is  noteworthy ,    as   it exemplifies a n institutional   commitment to broadly communicating

aVgrowing  strength in  innovation and entrepreneurship .  In addition,  through the Office of Marketing  and Communication, UH reaches large audiences on local, regional, national and  international stages via  various print publications,  LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.     Discussion  of  the   specific   information  disseminated   and  communication   channels used is beyond the  scope of this application. However, one  source very relevant  to   this application is the UH Institute for  Regional Forecasting (IRF) .  The IRF , established by Dr. Barton A. Smith in 1991,  provides essential, non - biased, economic  outlook  information  for the Houston economy and  the local community   including  bi - annual  symposia   on the Houston economy and local real estate markets . A  community fixture  since the  mid   19 - 19  ,   IRF   remain s   a valuable resource   for local businesses.  The IRF   also provides independent  economic  forecasting and other services to public and privat e sectors , both regionally and nationally . A  key  recurring  IRF  report    provides critical insight into  UH    and impact   on  local and regional economies and its  impact  on the economic prosperity of the region   (See Appendix 3 for e xcerpts of the 2013 report ).

In 2008 ,  industry partners Devon Energy and Marathon Oil  (who subsequently  became founding members of the UH Energy Advisory Board)  proposed that establishing an  undergraduate petroleu m engineering program would help to alleviate critical industry workforce  shortage s   not only in the US ,  but world - wide. The program was initiated with a seed grant of $1.6  million from the two companies and the University began looking for a suitable place   to house this new  program. A 74 acre parcel of land adjacent to the main campus was chosen as the future home for the  program and named the UH Energy Research Park (UH - ERP). The UH - ERP campus was formerly the  headquarters for oil services leader Schlumber ger, although the facilities had remained idle for nearly  fifteen years. With additional support from ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Schlumberger, General Electric  and others,  UH purchased the site which

aVPetroleum Engineering program, which now has    engineering program, notably the first of its type in the US and one of only five such education and  training programs in the world, is co - located at UH - ERP. This pr ogram offers both an M S degree   in  Subsea Engineering and graduate level certificates; both of which fill critical future work - force needs as  industry shifts to a greater emphasis on subsea oil technologies.    Healthcare is the largest and fastest growing  industry in the State of Texas. It has been estimated that by  2016 ,  one in every seven new jobs in Texas is projected to be in the healthcare industry.   Even though   nearly one - third of the total degrees awarded by the UH System are in a health - related fiel d, UH will  have to significantly expand current programs and create a number of new educational tracks to support  the projected work - force demands of a number of emerging fields in the health - care industry. The UH  System already produces 100% of the locall y trained optometrists, speech - language pathologists,  applied behavior analysts and family therapists. In addition, the UH System produces the majority of  pharmacists (52%), social workers (86%), clinical and school psychologists (67%) and nutritionists (7 5%)  employed in the region. Taken together, this translates to  a  critical role in the region .    UH awards a  preponderance (63%) of baccalaureate degrees in fields that are considered core elements of health  profession programs.

By eliminating redundan t   coursework and redefining curricula, students  comp lete Bachelor of Science and Doctor of Medicine degrees in seven years as opposed to a traditional  eight - year path. Twenty - three Honors Biomedical students enrolled in this program in the fall of 2013  and enrollment is projected to  exceed   200 students   by   2 016. Similarly, a dual - degree program between  the College of Liberal Arts & Social Sciences and UT Health offers students a Bachelor of Arts and  Bachelor of Science in Nursing.  A Master of Athletic Training program implemented in 2013 will also  provide a  critical work force in this rapidly expanding market.   In 2013, the Center for Arts Leadership was formed at UH to spearhead institutional efforts to formally  engage the arts industry   in Houston and the region .  UH  is   a national innovator ,  commissioning new  art  work, employing and training thousands of artists and sponsoring world class arts series , all of which  ha ve   contributed to overall success . To capitalize  on the geographical proximity and the wealth of  experience in the local arts , the  UH  community  for med the Center for Arts Leadership which brings  together artists, community, faculty and industry professionals around policy, research and best  practices in the arts. Through annual symposia and strategic partnerships between university and  community enti ties, the Center  for Arts Leadership  investigates, creates and tests  innovative practices   in  the arts.  The newly established Master of Arts program in the Center for Arts Leadership takes an  entrepreneurial approach to preparing creative professionals to l aunch, administer and maintain arts  organizations of all sizes.

aV Accomplishment 2: Innovation and Technology Commercialization    translational research and  technology transfer. The creation of a sustainable innovation ecosystem at UH not only enhances the  academic experiences available to students ,  but also serves to expand the research base of faculty,  while bolstering  a  rapidly gr owing local entrepreneurial community. The added economic value created  by UH due to accelerated technology development and formation of start - up companies across multiple  industry sectors embodies the essence of an Innovation and Economic Prosperity unive rsity by fostering  a confluence of Talent, Innovation and Place.   UH created an integrated support infrastructure designed to capture the intellectual property (IP)  generated by its faculty and students, and to transfer that IP into useful , commercially val uable  products. This has increased  the  interest and participation of our faculty and students in innovation and   . This support includes  increased faculty recognition and rewards  (i.e. university level awards, inclusion of innovation/IP  creation as a factor in faculty work - load, annual reviews and tenure discussions), creation of a UH  Technology GAP fund to support technology development, partnering of faculty inventors with  entrep reneurial students for commercialization of UH IP and support for faculty and/or student start - up  formation at UH.   In 2013, DOR established a Technology GAP Fund to provide competitive technology awards specifically  focused on commercialization and rapid p rototype development.   UH created a generous royalty sharing  policy   rewarding  faculty inventors with a 40% share of net revenue generated by their invention as well  as a  20% return   to their academic home. Faculty inventors are recognized for their accomplis hments  during an annual presidential level awards ceremony  for   new patent s . This combination of  remuneration and recognition has incentivized prominent researchers to relocate to UH from other  institutions and is a likely contributor to   the  high retention  rate  amongst   current  faculty inventors.  These programs are another example of UH ad aptation   and  improvement   of   best practices from other  Universities and the larger start - up community to accelerate innovation and commercialization of   our   IP  portfolio.

p2054
aV  16     Over   the past five years UH has experienced dramatic increases in both the size of its IP portfolio and  the amount of revenue generated. UH patent applications have increased 360% from 2008 to 2013,  reaching a total of 158 issued and 212 pending U.S. patents i n 2013. Licensing income has grown from  just $600,000 in 2008 to $16.5 M in 2013 ranking UH No. 1 nationally in royalty generation among public  universities without a medical school.  The UH IP portfolio serves as a catalyst for start - up formation  with ove  efforts have yielded three mature faculty/student start - up companies operating or manufacturing at  UH - ERP, three UH start - ups in the biomedical field slated fo r occupancy of the new laboratory facilities  at UH - ERP and a total of 7 nascent, faculty inventor/student start - ups presently being incubated by the  UH Innovation Center (Appendices 2 & 4).   Unique public - private partnerships are expanding technology  commer cialization at UH including Project MIROS (a.k.a. ARMS), a joint venture with local VC firm Fannin   equally in the cost, participate in the management and sh are revenues derived from the venture and are  committed to a long term relationship that includes repeating the process with other medical  technologies. A second example is a partnership with a regional IP management firm (IPX, Inc.,  http://www.ipxco.com/who - we - are/about - us ) where IPX was given access to a subset of older patents  within the UH IP portfolio to conduct proprietary market analysis to  identify   those patents with  commercial value. Both UH  and IPX share any revenue generated by IPX identifying a licensee. IPX has  also directly licensed a series of patents covering semi - conductor resistive memory approaches where  IPX is the lead in commercializing these technologies.   One of the more impactful   examples of innovation and cultural/community activity can be found in Arte  Pblico Press, the largest and most established publisher of contemporary and recovered literature by  US Hispanic authors. In 1994, with support from the NAE and the Mellon Founda tion, Piata Books was  formed and has published 25 - 30 books per year focused on Hispanic culture. In 2009, Arte Pblico Press   - an  outreach program whose mission is   to expand access to important health and nutrition information   strategic partnership with the Texas Regional Collegiate Center (TCRC) who will develop the Ce nter for  University  Entrepreneurship (CUE) and create a $10M venture capital fund available for investment in  UH technologies. UH has also committed to co - investing an additional 20% in those UH technologies  funded by TCRC. The source of TCRC investment fu nds is the EB5 - immigrant investor program. It is  tempting to speculate that this project represents a unique fusion of the Kellogg and Carnegie types of  engagement.   Accomplishment 1: Education and Work - force Development   Energy sector education and workforce development are of critical importance to both the regional and  national economies.  In 2008 ,  the   leadership of the UH energy Advisory Board,   industry partners Devon  Energy and Marathon Oil proposed  the concept  that est ablishing an undergraduate petroleum  engineering program would help to alleviate  a  critical industry workforce shortage   not only in the US   but  Formatted:   Normal

Healthcare   is the largest and fastest growing industry in the State of Texas .  It has been estimated that by  2016   one in every seven new jobs   in Texas   is  projected  to be in the healthcare industry.   While currently   nearly one - third of the total degrees awarded by the UH System are in a health - related field, UH  will  have  to significantly   expand   current programs  and  creat e a number of   new educational  tracks  opportunities  to support the projected work - force demands of  a number of emerging fields in the  health - care industry .

By eliminating redundan cy   coursework and  redefining curricula, students complete Bachelor of Science and Doctor of Medicine degrees in seven  years as opposed to  a  traditional eight - year path. Twenty - three Honors Biomedic al students enrolled in  this program in the  f all of 2013 and enrollment is projected to  exceed   200 students   in   2016. Similarly, a  dual - degree program between the College of Liberal Arts & Social Sciences and UT Health offers  students a Bachelor of Arts and   Bachelor of Science in Nursing.  A Master of Athletic Training program  implemented in 2013 will  also provide a critical  work   force in  this   rapidly expanding market.   In 2013, the Center for Arts Leadership was formed at UH to spearhead institutional effort s to formally  engage the  arts  industry.

aV   Accomplishment 2: Innovation and Technology Commercialization   UH  is committed to enhancing    technology transfer.   The creation of a   sustainable  innovation   ecosystem  at UH  not only enhances the  academic experiences available to  our  students   but also   serves to expand the research base of  our  faculty, while bolstering  a  rapidly growing local entrepreneurial community.   The added economic value  created by UH due to accelerated technology development and formation of start - up companies across  multiple ind ustry sectors embodies the essence of an Innovation and Economic Prosperity university by  fostering a confluence of Talent, Innovation and Place.   UH  created   an integrated support infrastructure designed to capture the intellectual property (IP)  generated b y its faculty and students,  and  to transfer that IP into useful   products   that have commercial  value . T his  has increased  interest and participation of our faculty and students in  innovation   and   , such as  increased faculty  recognition and rewards (i.e. university level awards, inclusion of innovation/IP creation as a factor in  faculty work - load, annual reviews and tenur e discussions),   creation of a UH Technology GAP fund to  support technology development,  partnering of faculty inventors with entrepreneurial students for  commercialization of UH IP and support for faculty and/or student start - up  formation   at UH.

aV  21     In 2013, D OR established a Technology GAP Fund to provide competitive  technology  awards specifically  focused on   commercialization and rapid prototype development.    Also,  UH  also  created a   generous   royalty sharing policy   which   reward s   f aculty inventors  with a   40% share of  net  revenue generated by  their invention as well  as a  20% return   to the ir   academic home.  F aculty inventors are recognized for  their accomplishments during an annual presidential level awards ceremony  for   new patent s . This  combination of remun eration and recognition has incentivized prominent researchers to relocate to UH  from other institutions and is a likely contributor to   the  high retention rate  amongst   current  faculty  inventors.  These programs are an other   example of UH ad aptation   and  improvement   of   best practices  from other Universities and the larger start - up community to accelerate innovation and  commercialization of   our   IP portfolio.   Over the past five years UH has experienced dramatic increases in both the size of its IP portfolio   and  the amount of revenue generated. UH patent applications have increased 360% from 2008 to 2013,  reaching a total of 158 issued and 212 pending U.S. patents in 2013 .   L icensing income has grown from  just $600,000 in 2008 to $16.5 M in 2013 rank ing UH   No.   1 nationally in royalty  generation   among public  universities without a medical school.     The UH  IP   portfolio  serve s   as  a  catalyst for start - up  formation   with over 20 companies fo rmed in the last decade   still in business in the region today  efforts   ha ve   yielded three  mature  faculty/student start - up companies operating or manufacturing   at  UH - ERP , three UH start - ups in the biomedical field slated for occupancy of the new laboratory facilities  at UH - ERP and a total of  7   nascen t, faculty inventor/student start - ups presently being incubated  by   the  UH Innovation Center   (Appendi ces 2 &   4) .   Unique public - private partnerships  are  expan ding   technology  commercialization at UH   including   Project MIROS (a.k.a. ARMS), a joint venture with  local VC firm Fannin  Innovation Studio   ( FIS )  which  exemplifies  a   type  economic engagement. Both partners share  equally  in  the cost, participate in the management and share revenues derived from the venture   and  a re   committed to a long term relationship that includes repeating the process with other  medical  technologies .  A second   example is a partnership with a   regional IP management firm (IPX, Inc.,  http://www.ip xco.com/who - we - are/about - us )   where IPX was given access to a subset of older patents  within the UH IP portfolio   to conduct   proprietary  market  analysis   to  determine  those patents with  commercial value .  B oth UH and IPX share  any   the  revenue generated   by IPX identifying a licensee . IPX  has also  directly licens ed   a series of patents covering semi - conductor resistive memory  approaches  where IPX is the lead in commercializing these technologies.   One of the more impactful examples of  innovation and cultura l/community activity can be found in Arte Pblico Press, the largest and most  established publisher of contemporary and recovered literature by US Hispanic authors. In 1994, with  support from the  NAE   and the Mellon  F oundation, Piata Books was formed and h as published 25 - 30  books per year focused on Hispanic culture. In 2009, Arte Pblico Press received a grant from the   - an outreach program whose  mission is to expand access to important heal th and nutrition information through lively and engaging     Finally, UH has recently formed a 40 year strategic partnership with the Texas  Regional Collegiate Center (TCRC) who will develop the Center for Entrepreneurship (CUE) and   create a  $10 M   venture capital fund available for investment in UH technologies.

aVby   while   highlighting   how  and  why   these efforts add to the economic prosperity of the region.   UH has made significant progress in responding to evolving work - force demands   in the   energy ,   healthcare  and arts  sectors of the local ,   regional   and national  economies   (see Section 2) .  Given the   rapidly changing   technical ,  regulatory   and cultural considerations   in  all three areas , it is critical that   UH  continue  the  current practice of actively engaging  with   industry and business leaders hip   to ensure  robust  eco nomic engagement .  UH has   bui lt a great deal of momentum in this area  as demonstrated by  the significant number of  programs presently underway which are responsive to the evolving need s of  industry and business.   ontinued success  demands that it   remain agile, flexible and responsive in  all dimensions of  this task   including research, training, education, and entrepreneurship.  Critical to  future  success  will be  continued   close interact ion   with   varied   advisory boards  and   the maintenance  of   an  o ngoing dialogue   between a   diverse range of industries, public o fficials, and regional leaders.  The  a p pointment of   Chief Energy ,  Health  and   Arts Officer s   as A ppointment   of  highly visible, senior  leadership  in the form of   Chief Energy, Health and Arts  Officers   to facilitate this process  has been a  pivotal moment in the evolution of the economic engagement enterprise at UH . This  has not only  ceme nted  these  initiatives   as  strategic  priorities   but also   provid es   a coordinating force within each area   viewed  by  both  administrators and faculty alike as  a  major  positive  step  in solidifying UH  as  a nationally recognized, Tier One academic research institution .   T here  is still   a clear need for  accurate, timely  information to  ensure   a  comprehensive truly   University - wide  perspective and  strategic  approach to economic engagement   university - wide .  T o  systematically  address this issue ,  the IEP team   suggests   that  the  UH  leadership considers  develop ing   a central  r epository for information specifically designed t o catalogue  and track  ALL  programs which include   elements of   work - force development  and /or   economic engagement activities .   Tracking w ill   begin at  program  conception (usually  at the individual unit level),  continue  through their development  and  official recognition by the university  as academic/training programs, and  include  tracking of program  graduates in the work - force.  The responsibility for  initiat ing   and updat ing this   tracking   information  would be the responsibility of the individual   un it   initiating the program   and be implemented through a  centrally maintained on - line portal .  This approach   would  allow  campus  units with similar goals to  collaborate as early as   possible in  new  program conception ,  guard against  the  establishment of   redundan t or competing programs,  and ,    whe re   appropriate ,    allow additional  university  resources  to be  engaged .   In addition, each college would be responsible for providing information   to be   collated in a  central repository cataloguing existing and future programs   that  involve   economic engagement  activities.  This information datab ase would be up - dated on  a  regular   basis,  be  linked to the ongoing  tracking system and   be  made widely available to  the  campus community .

Accountability for providing such information would be l inked to authorization   to  proceed with any future programs or initiatives.   This i nformation  would  then  be used to produce  informational and promotional  materials  for  UH  thereb y  addressing  in  part   by   the IEP  self - study .     While  such a  tracking / database  system  will provide  institutional   awareness, such  a  system must be  coupled with the development of   a central  point of contact/ connection portal   for external stakeholders  wishing to engage  in economic engagement activities  with   UH.  A central  connection  portal has the  advantage   of   seamlessly  channeling   external stakeholders interested in developing specific relationships  to  with  those units/individuals on campus most likely to be helpful in meeting their  needs. Just as  importantly, it also  provide s   a  single, easily  accessed site   for   a   -  experience  relative  to  why   and  how   prospective partners can engage in  economic engagement activities   with UH .   This  solution addresses some of the specific items identified by external stakeholders as areas for  improvement   (Append ix 5)    economic engagement activities. An additional advantage of developing an integrated  central access  portal and tracking database  is to   allow  truly  accurate   evidence - based outcomes  assessment of the  economic  impact of specific  UH  efforts by providing a clear understanding of the input (i.e. need,  stakeholders, rationale and resources   deployed ) versus the output generated by these efforts (i.e. new  programs for med, external stakeholder satisfaction, students graduated, graduates employed, start - up  companies formed , jobs created, etc.).   Ultimately, t o   have a   long - lasting ,    truly  lasting and  transformative impact   on the local and regional  economies ,    UH  has been and continues to  creat e   a sustainable entrepreneurial ecosystem foster ing   a  true innovation economy centered in Houston   and the region .  UH is playing a leading role in developing   -  required  for  the City of  Houston  and the region  to  rival such established innovation centers as Silicon Valley, the Bay Area ,  the Northeast  corridor   and the growing Austin, TX innovation community .   UH is accelerating   this  process  by creating   a  campus cultu re where innovation and entrepreneurship are both recognized and rewarded, while  encouraging both faculty and students to become involved in  activities   ,  which   translate fundamental  academic research into commercially valuable products and services.

In  addition, the  i nnovatio n and entrepreneurial opportunities offered by UH  will  be incorporated as  standard into any new faculty hiring/interview process , and   the educational opportunities available  to  our STEM students  in entrepreneurship around technology commercialization  of UH   IP  will  be widely  communicated   to our STEM students .  A dditional training  in grantsmanship for STTR/SBIR  funding will be  provided  for faculty and students  on  campus  in addition to   other   sites .

aVIncreasingly, major urban areas recognize the vital relationship that exists between economic  development, the education of its work force and the presence of quality institutions of higher  education. Simply put, urban economies where institutions of higher education play a prominent role  are stronger and more robust than those without such institutions. Houston is certainly no exception.  The benefits generated by the four universities of the   University of Houston System (UHS) make a   diverse that no single entity can claim exceptionality. With thousands of companies and governmental  and non - profit or ganizations in Houston, it is impressive that only a dozen or so economic institutions,  private or public, are more important than UHS to the Houston economy. Put into context, UHS has a   r or Halliburton.

Assigning a dollar figure to such   services is beyond the scope of  the  IRF  study, but  they are clearly of value to the region and Appendix 6 provides an overview (not a comprehensive  list) of such assets.   For context, Appendix 6 of the Barton Smith Report is 65 pages in length and  covers the community activities for entir e University of Houston System. The final paragraph of the  IRF report is very instructive and has been included in its entirety   as follows:

aVit updates a cautionary observation from  the 2006 report. Overall, Houston still continues to invest less than many other urban areas in  providing higher education resources and in producing its own college grad uates. Thus far, a  prosperous Houston has been successful in recruiting a high - skilled work force from outside the region  to meet this shortfall. But it is progressively more precarious for an urban area to leave a sizeable  portion of its population withou t higher education and to fail to develop a sufficient source of its own
p2126
aV Clearly, the  2013 IRF/Barton Smith  report provides important goal s   with regard to the continued need for  work - force   education and development for ensuring the continu ed growth and prosperity of the Houston  and regional economies. The various programs, initiatives and strategic goals detailed in this IEP  application clearly demonstrate that  UH  has   not only recognized these challenges but more importantly is  aggressively    recognized as a nationally recognized, Tier One research institution while meeting the needs of the local  and regional economies is  a central tenet in the growth and   improvement plan defined in this application.

aVUniversity of Idaho Application  Innovation and  Economic Prosperity  2013 University Designation and Award Program  Process Narrative  Introduction  \u0152 In the economic engagement  context ,  Innovation  is the creation of a  new  process , idea ,  product , institution,  or  technology  that  allows  members of  society to  more efficiently use their  resources to obtain more of the things they desire , and is the  primary contributor to increasing  prosperity of humanity over time.   Economic  Prosperity is the  relative  condition of  most people having  sufficient income for  essentials with perhaps a little mor e, business hiring, and jobs  relatively easy to  obtain.  Economic prosperity  is reflected by personal happiness, physical, emotional,  and financial  health, and  a strong community fabric.    The University\u2122s  economic devel opment  mission statement proclaims its commitment to  Innovation and Economic Prosperity : - collaborate in creating a vibrant and sustainable economy that improves quality of life  - advance innovation  - help employers grow and prosper  - strengthen communities and r egional economies  The University\u2122s varied programs, some of which are mentioned in this application , exemplify this  commitment .  We explain below the pathways we have traveled to better understand the condition of  our present economic engagements, identify  the proper roles for Idaho\u2122s higher education institutions in  economic engagement, and establish goals to help us meet our internal and external stakeholders\u2122  expectations.  Process Experience  \u0152 The University of Idaho  (University)  has a  120+ year  history  of economic  engagement.  However, there ha d been little common vision, mission, or coordination.  In 2010, the  
p2135
aVOffice of Economic Development (OED) was formed  to help create the common vision, mission, and  goals .    To begin to understand the  University\u2122s  role  in economic engagement , OED  staff  research ed what other universities, particularly land -grants, were saying about their economic engagement.  Six  general economic  engagement  role s emerged across many universities:  (1) the university as a large  business/economic enterprise, (2) preparing a skilled workforce, (3) technology  transfer/commercialization, (4) corporate sponsored research, (5) business assistance programs, and (6)  community and civic capacity development.   We have been  engaged in  each of  these, but we needed  more clarity on how our stakeholders wanted us supporting economic  engagement .  OED became aware of the APLU/CICEP  Institutional Assessment Tools to Enhance Regional  Innovation and Prosperity and decid ed to implement both the internal and external tools.  Th e internal  constituents were  University faculty and staff whose duties were  related to economic engagement .  External constituents consisted of local, state, tribal and federal government officials,  business leaders,  and communit y organizations.  Survey respondents included  312 internal constituents (32 % response  rate) and 235 external constituents (23% response rate).  The strongest message, received from both  groups, was that the University does no t effectively communicate  its economic engagement s or their  impacts.   (See Growth/Improvement Plan for more details.)  External constituents did rank talent  development activities as highest in importance and in our performance.   As a follow -up to the surv eys and a means to obtain more specific input, the  University hosted  the 2012 Idaho Economic Development Summit: Defining the Role of Higher Education in Economic   Development : http://idahoeconomic summit.com/edsummit.php .  Working with the state\u2122s seven other  public institutions of higher education,  the University invited  industry leaders, economic development   professionals, government leaders and other economic development stakeholders to the Summi t to  discuss how public higher education can best support Idaho -based economic development now  and into  
p2136
aVthe future.  Over 200 individuals from across Idaho participated in these discussions.  In six concurrent  breakouts, the attendees identified and priori tized specific roles for higher education in talent,  technology, firm/business, industrial cluster, re gional, and quality  connected place development.   Key  takeaways were the desire for more collaboration between higher education institutions and all the   stakeholders, being responsive to economic development needs of all stakeholders, and to better   communicate with stakeholders about economic development opportunities and outcomes.
p2137
aV The  University\u2122s Entrepreneurial Task Force used  the input from  these a ctivities to  develop  the  University\u2122s economic development mission and economic  engagement  goals.    The University of Idaho's mission in economic development is to collaborate in creating a vibrant  and sustainable economy that improves quality of life and  benefits Idaho, the region and   beyond.   We do this by mobilizing resources to advance innovation, help employers grow a nd  prosper, strengthen communities  and regional economies, and create an educated workforce.   Goal 1: Better Communicate the University\u2122 s Economic Engagement  Goal 2:  Increased Involvement by University Personnel in Economic Engagement  Goal 3: Improved Understanding of Economic Development Needs Across Idaho  The se goals  have become part of our Growth/Improvement Plan.   OED  continues to be  an active participant in the CICEP Metrics Working Group and  was  a beta  site for testing the ability to collect the proposed metrics and determining their value to stakeholders.   Although stakeholders found the proposed metrics informative, they were more  interested in impacts  than the reporting of activities.  We  continue  examining  metrics that reflect the interests of selected  groups and support our efforts to measure progress.  The Economic Engagement Enterprise  \u0152 Goal 3 of t he University \u2122s  strategic plan is \ufb01Outreach and  Engagement: Meet society\u2122s critical needs by engaging in mutually beneficial partnerships.\ufb02   The context  for that goal as provided in the strategic plan is as follows:  As the state\u2122s land -grant institution, the University of Idaho is uniquely positioned to expand its  impact in Idaho and beyond.   We seek to achieve that end through engagement --working across  
p2138
aVdisciplines; integrating teaching, research, and outreach; and p artnering with constituents for  the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and resources.   Partnering is the key word.  The  University\u2122s use of the term  \ufb01engagement \ufb02 requires that the parties  each have a need, that each party is directly involved in mee ting those needs, and that each party\u2122s  need is addressed.   We received Carnegie\u2122s Community Engaged Institution classification for Engagement and  Outreach and Partnerships  in 2010 .  In 2010 and again in 2013, the  University was  the Western regional  winner  and national  finalist for the Magrath/Kellogg Engagement Award, which is presented by APLU to  institutions that have demonstrated exemplary engagement activities.   We received an honorable  mention in 2012.   These are  recognitions  of the  University\u2122s commi tment to engagement.   The  University\u2122s economic engagement activities are found across the breadth of the institution.   Examples include   The Center for Food Business and Technology provides a multi -use facility where individuals and  food companies can rece ive comprehensive business, technical and educational assistance to  develop or improve their food business.   The Bioregional Planning & Community Design program engages  students  with people and  institution s in Idaho communities and tribe s to work together t o improve the quality of life and  build sustainable futures.     The Small Business  Law C linic assists small businesses with legal matters associated with  formation of an appropriate business entity, preparation and review of confidentiality and  employment a greements,  and  review of commercial leases, for example.     The Economic Development  Law  Clinic advises Idaho counties, cities, tribes, and non -governmental agencies with economic development issues arising in questions of land use law,  administrative law,  state and local government law, and environmental law.  
p2139
aV The Agriculture Extension and Experiment Station programs support the agriculture industry  through the development of new plant varieties, agronomic and production animal  management practices, and  busi ness management and marketing support.   TechHelp provides technical and professional assistance that helps Idaho manufacturers,  processors and inventor s accelerate growth and profitability through continuous product and  process innovation.   The Business Proc ess Center conducts process improvement projects to  increase  companies\u2122  effectiveness.   The  University operates two business  incubators and a research park and has an active  technology transfer/commercialization program.  These are but a very few examples of our economic engagement  programs .  The  University \u2122s internal structure for  supporting economic engagement  includes  OED, formed  to  create the university\u2122s common vision, mission, and go als around economic development, an d the  Entrepreneurial Task Force,  which  helps  support and guide those efforts.  The Task Forces  comprises  the  deans from the colleges of Business and Economics and Engineering ,  the  director of Agricultural  Extension,  the  director of the Office of Community  Partnerships, the chair of the Department of  Agricultural Economics and Rural Sociology, the associate vice president for economic development, and  two private sector representatives.     The Office of Community Partnerships works with communities to  advan ce innovation and sustainability, build leadership, and create vibrant communities.    Economic Engagement Planning  \u0152 The  University\u2122s current strategic plan promotes engagement broadly.   We are to (1) partner with other education institutions, industry, no t-for -profits, and public agencies to  expand resources and expertise, (2) recognize and reward engagement with communities, businesses,   non -profits, and agencies, and (3) increase the application of and public access to the results of scholarly  and creativ e activities.  With a significant turn -over in leadership (president, provost, and 3 deans) and  
p2140
aVthe expiration of the current strategic plan about 1 year following the leadership change, we have an  opportunity to strengthen inclusion of economic engagement  throughout our plans and activities.  The  recently developed university -wide economic developmen t mission provides guidance.   Over the next academic term, we will be updating  our 2010  inventory  of economic engagement  activities .  The inventory will be use d, in part, to identify related programs and activities that if  coordinated could be stronger and more impactful.  An example is the creation of the Food Systems and   Economic Development Initiative.  This Initiative brought together a number of faculty and  staff that  were individually or in small groups working on different food systems activities.  Together, this Initiative  has provided a venue through which to submit proposals to larger and more diverse funding  opportunities, identify projects support ing  a large number of the individual activities, and  share and  leverage the knowledge and activities across the group.  This can be replicated in other topical areas.    Staff support has been largely provided by AmeriCorp s Members supervised by OED.   The Entrep reneurial Task Force will continue to promote economic engagement by the  University and identify specific initiatives that can be implemented to  increase the involvement of  faculty, staff, and students in economic outreach and engagement.  Progress in achi eving the  Growth/Improvement Plan will be monitored by the Task Force.  Methods for regularly obtaining input   from stakeholders will be developed.   We plan to implement the Institutional Assessment Tools again in  2015 to measure progress as observed by our  external and internal constituents.  Promotion and Communication  \u0152 This is one of the  University\u2122s Growth/Improvement Plan Goals.   The  University has a variety of audiences it needs to reach regarding its economic engagement , including  prospect ive  students and their parents, communities, businesses, government agencies, economic  development organizations/professionals, higher education institutions, our faculty and staff, alumni,   and the general public.    
p2141
aV The primary purpose  of  promotion and commu nication  is to create additional opportunities for  economic engagement  for students and faculty with the various external audiences.  As the audiences  learn more about what is possible, how economic engagement works, and the benefits, they are more  likely  to be interested and willing to be part of those engagements.  It is well understood that \ufb01success  breeds success .\ufb02  The secondary  purpose  is to generate more good will and support for  University programs.  If  potential donors, legislators, and the general  public see that the  University is not only developing well  educated graduates but is also providing other public benefits through economic engagement, they are   more likely to increase their giving/funding.  The political benefits are powerful.   Our commun ication strategies are evolving  \u0152 see Growth/Improvement Plan  Goal 1.   Until  recently,  there has been no specific strategy around economic engagement.  Based on the input from  the surveys,  the  Summit, and conversations with stakeholders across the state, w e have developed  economic engagement specific communication  platforms, including  websites, Facebook,  Twitter,  and  LinkedIn.   We will still utilize the more traditional media outlets as appropriate.   One non -traditional aspect of our economic engagement com munications/promotion strategy is  to use these platforms to communicate and promote the related activities of others along with ours.   The OED website,  http://www.uidaho.edu/research/econo mic -development , allows internal and  external constituents to submit events for the calendar and stories about their projects.  We post  information/links to programs offered by others, such as Boise State University\u2122s Innovation Teams  program or Valley Visions Food Hub W orkshop,  on our Idaho Economic Development Network Facebook  page:  https://www.facebook.com/pages/Idaho -Economic -Development -Network/280661652013408 .   This pl atform is also used to post relevant information about Idaho\u2122s economic activity, such as updates  from the Census Bureau or Bureau of Economic Analysis.  
p2142
aV Economic engagement project or subject matter specific websites have also been created to  communicate and share information to project participants (behind a firewall) and the general public.   Examples include the Idaho Pathways project and the Food System s and Economic Development  Initiative.  The Idaho Pathways project involves multiple economic development stakeholders across  Idaho working to develop a statewide comprehensive economic development strategy.  The   website,  http://blogs.uidaho.edu/idaho -pathways/ , provides the general public updates about the  project and general information about economic activity in Idaho.  Behind the firewall is inform ation  specific about the project, including  meeting  materials, asset mapping data,  results of economic  modeling, and presentation materials.  As these are validated, they move to the public portion of the  site.  The new Food Systems and Economic Development Initiative  website,  http://blogs.uidaho.edu/food -systems/ , is designed to provide resources to those audiences  interested in learning more about food systems.  As university programs generate /collect  new  information about food systems, it  is posted  for eas y retriev al and used by students to understand what  has already been done or communities considering developing a commercial kitchen or farmers marke t,  for example . Advancing University Economic Engagement  \u0152 The  University has  the  leadership role in e conomic  engagement across Idaho.  As Idaho\u2122s land -grant and flagship university, we have engaged the rest of  Idaho\u2122s public higher education with our external stakeholders in the Idaho Economic Summit 2012: The  role of higher education in economic developm ent.   We invited  Boise State University and Idaho State  University to participate in our meeting with stakeholders to discuss the APLU/CICEP metrics initiative  and the value of the proposed metrics.  This leadership role was recognized by  Seattle Office of  the  Economic Development Administration as i llustrated by their asking the U niversity to lead what became   the Idaho Pathways project to create a statewide comprehensive economic development strategy.   The  
p2143
aVUniversity\u2122s Associate Vice President for Economic  Development is a member of the University Economic  Development Association\u2122s Board of Directors.   The  University has been an active participant in several APLU/CICEP initiatives.  We  were an  early adopter of the  Institutional Assessment  tools ,  implementing both the external and internal  instruments.  Our involvement in the metrics initiative led us to become one of the beta sites, host of  the metrics stakeholder meetings, and an invited participant at the October 2012 Metrics Focus Group   Meeting .  Participant  continues  in the ongoing metrics initiative activities.  As a member of the first  Innovation and Economic Prosperity Designation and Awards Program  cohort , the  University has shared  experiences through the conference  calls , Basecamp  and work shops , as well as  provided  a panelist at  University of Georgia\u2122s workshop  Raising the Stakes: Economic Development at UGA .   The  University\u2122s  practices are portable and scalable.   The  University openly shares  its  economic  engagement experiences and practic es with others.   Sharing  includes  phone and e -mail exchanges,  participation as a presenter at meetings and conferences,  and  recognitions and awards.  The  Magrath/Kellogg Engagement Award program highlights exemplary engagements.  The National  Academy of En gineering\u2122s recognition of the University of Idaho Engineering Capstone Program  achievements highlights a program that  engages engineering students with industry partners to solve  complex business problems.  Their report, Infusing Real World Experiences in to Engineering Education  (http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=18184&page=2 ), describes the program\u2122s Capstone -Industry Partnerships.   Improving our  disseminat ion of  information  about these practices  will be built  into  our  communications Growth/Improvement Plan.   
p2144
aVGrowth/Improvement Plan  The three areas of improvement are  expanding  communications, increasing involvement by university  personnel, and  improving our understanding of e conomic development needs across Idaho.  The  University\u2122s Entrepreneurial Task Force established these as  University -wide goals based on input  received through the use of the CICEP Institutional Assessment Tools and the 2012 Idaho Economic  Summit participa nts.  Goal 1: Better Communicate the U niversity\u2122s Economic   Engagement  \u0152 Approximately 85% of  respondents to both the external and internal CICEP Institutional Assessments saw as important or very  important reporting economic development contributions to ke y stakeholders and developing  communication strategies that highlight successful collaborations.  However, only 35% of the external  respondents thought we did a good or very good job of reporting economic development contributions  to key stakeholders.  Onl y 46% of the internal respondents thought we did a good or very good job.   Many  respondents included  comments in the Open -Ended Comments sections of the surveys related to  a desire to know what the university was doing .  Over a third from the external cons tituents responded  to the question \ufb01Do you have any additional comments about the University of Idaho as a collaborator   on economic development efforts?\ufb02  had comments similar to the following:   There needs to be more communication between my organization a nd the University.   There is a need to consistently and better communicate servi ces to 'rural' communities .   I am unaware of any UofI Economic Development efforts in and around our community.  It  would certainly be very welcome and appreciated.   Make a bette r effort to make sure that ED organizations are better informed about just what  you do and how they can take advantage of what you have to offer.  Internal constituents\u2122 comments were like these:  
p2145
aV Lack of communication across departments and colleges. Facult y/ staff have a hard time finding  out what the UI is involved in outside of their department and, most especially, how they can  become involved.   Lack of information of opportunities, access to efforts  This ineffective communication  negatively effects  student recruitment, engagement with stakeholders,  and participation by  University faculty, staff, and students.  Potential students are often seeking  opportunities to impact communities and the economy.  If we do an inadequate job of letting them  know ab out those types of opportunities, they will choose to go elsewhere.  Stakeholders may have  economic development needs that are not being addressed because they do not know that the  University can bring resources to help.  If faculty and staff do not unders tand that the  University values  these type of engagements or does not understand how they could become engaged, they are not as  likely to be involved.  Effective communication will let each of these groups know what is possible and  lead to more economic en gagements with and by the  University.   The top barriers to improving the  effectiveness of these communications would be a lack of commitment for improvement and to  properly resource the effort.  Having this set as a  University -wide goal should help overcom e these  potential barriers.   The  Communications  Growth/Improvement Plan  involves developing general communication  strategies and audience specific strategies.  I have been advised by a past editor of the Idaho Business  Review that universities need to bett er address the interests of the intended audience both in content  and in style.  Too often, the communication sounds like we are addressing our peers when we are trying   to engage the public.  An AmeriCorp s Member with strong communication experience is bei ng hired for  this coming year to work with University Communications and Marketing in developing these strategies.   Based on the strategies crafted, we will work with the Office of Research and Economic Development\u2122s  writer and Communications and Marketing  to implement those strategies.  It will take about 9 months  
p2146
aVto fully  develop the economic engagement communications plan.  At that time, we can  gau ge the need  for additional writers.  No paid promotions are anticipated.     The University plans to use the  external and internal surveys again in 2015.  This will set the  benchmark against which we can monitor improvement in respondents\u2122 awareness responses in future  surveys.   It will be more difficult to measure all the economic engagements across the entire U niversity.   However, the engagements in service -learning projects are captured. (See Goal 2)  Effective external and  internal communications should result in an increased number of those external and internal  constituents participating.  Goal 2:  Increased  Involvement by University Personnel  in Economic Engagement  \u0152 As with  communications, approximately 85% of respondents in both the external and internal survey thought it  was important or very important that the  University encourage  the  engagement of facult y and staff in  economic development activities in the state and region.  In both surveys, only 40% of respondents  thought the  University was doing a good or very good job of encouraging that engagement.   Comments  such as the following were common in the in ternal survey\u2122 s Open -Ended Comments section  in response  to the question \ufb01What do you feel is the biggest barrier for faculty and staff to become engaged in   economic development efforts?\ufb02:  There are few rewards and many risks for going outside of our job de scriptions or for deviating  from work that would not be rewarded in the Promotion and Tenure process.   This perception  hampers the  University\u2122s ability to  be a fully involve  in e conomic engagement activities  as might be possible, reducing our ability to  work with others to make positive economic development  contributions.   It is important that the  Univer sity ensure that  faculty, staff, and their supervisors  understand that economic engagement is important and supported.  However, we must move beyond   \ufb01We h ave always done things this way\ufb02 and implement effective incentives and rewards.  If Idaho is to  move upward from 40 th nationally in median household income, we all need to be  doing our part.   If we  
p2147
aVare successful in creating greater involvement by faculty  and staff, we should see an increase in the  number of companies (about 25 in 2012  \u0152 2013), communities (about 15 in 2012  \u0152 2013), and other  economic development organizations (about  20 in 2012  \u0152 2013) engaged in service -learning projects .  The number  of R &D  projects  with  for -profit businesses and industry -based organizations  shou ld also  increase; about 57 and 154 projects in 2011  \u0152 2012, respectively.     Of the 3 goals, this one is the most critical for growing/improving the University\u2122s economic  engagemen t.  It may also be the most difficult to achieve as it will require a culture change over time.   If  the University cannot increase the involvement by faculty and staff, improvements in communications  and understanding the needs of our constituents will hav e little impact on growing/improving our  economic engagement.   A long -term objective would be the inclusion of credit for economic engagement in faculty  promotion and tenure  (P&T) process .  There are universities across the U.S. that have provided credit i n  the P&T process.  They can provide models for how to implement the change and the specifics about the   nature of the appropriate credits.  University leadership needs to lead this change by setting this as a  priority.     In the short -term, implementing a  program of incentives and rewards  will be used to encourage  more involvement by faculty and staff in economic engagement programs.   Some members of the  Entrepreneurial Task Force suggest this approach may actually be more effective than making changes in  the P&T process.  Identifying potentially effective incentives and rewards will be important.  We will  work with the Research Council, the Outreach and Engagement Council, Entrepreneurial Task Force, and  others to identify the appropriate incentives/rewards .  Incentives could include buying -out time from  other activities in order to plan economic engagement programs, providing support for graduate  students, or providing administrative support in working through perceived internal administrative  barriers.  
p2148
aVGoa l 3: Improved Understanding of Economic Development Needs Across Idaho  \u0152 In the surveys and  discussions at the Summit, aligning resources with economic development needs was identified as a key  role of the  University.   For example, 90% of the external surv ey respondents thought it was important or  very important that the  University align its strengths with the needs of regional business and industry.   In addition, 87% thought it was important or very important that the  University align its strengths with  the economic development needs of communities.  Ninety percent (90%) had the same response to the   University understanding state and local governments\u2122 regional economic development priorities.   From  the Summit,  alignment  and responsiveness rank high in each of the 6 economic development categories  discussed:  Industry Cluster  \u0152 Create a  more nimble response to match curriculum to cluster needs  \u0152 1st priority  Quality Connected Place  \u0152 Higher education needs to ask, listen a nd take action  \u0152 4th highest priority  Firm/Enterprise  \u0152 More collaboration with private sector in problem solving  \u0152 2nd highest priority  Talent  \u0152 Increasing collaboration between higher education and business  \u0152 3rd highest priority  Technology  \u0152 Communicate  more effectively and efficiently between higher education, the  community, economic development community and the market; what does the market want and  what does higher education need to do  \u0152 highest priority  Regional  \u0152 Increased partnership  across  higher  education, industry, and public sector  \u0152 1st priority  As Idaho\u2122s land -grant  University, we need to do applied scholarship in addition  to the fundamental  scholarship, including  creating an educated workforce to meet present and emerging skill and  knowledge  requirements, helping companies develop new products and markets, assisting communities  in revitalization efforts , etc.   If we do not understand the present and emerging needs, we cannot  effectively apply our resources to support those stakeholders.   Under standing the needs , however,  does  not mean that the  University would necessarily change to  directly  address the need.  Addressing the  need may be inconsistent with the  University\u2122s mission, resources, or timeframe.  There may be more  appropriate resources available to appropriately address the need.  However, understanding the need  
p2149
aVallows the  University to help identify the appropriate resources.   Historically, it takes t ime for  universities to evolve to address changing needs.  Often the stakeholders are identifying today\u2122s needs.   By the time higher education has adjusted to meet that need, it is gone and another need has emerged.   Getting stakeholders to project needs o ut 5  \u0152 10 years will be necessary to make the ultimate goal of  being responsive to needs achievable.     There is already an effort underway in  the Idaho Workforce  Council.   The Council wants to  formalize its ties to many partnerships and groups throughout  the state that are engaged in industry -focused workforce and economic development activities. The council hopes to provide these groups   with a statewide forum to bring workforce challenges and employment and training issues to policy  makers.   Through these  forums, it is anticipated industry would identify current and future  workforce/talent needs for Idaho\u2122s education providers.   This is a collaborative  effort  including  the Idaho  Department of Labor, Idaho State Board of Education,  the American Manufacturer  Network, the  Boise  Valley Economic Partnership, the Idaho Aerospace Alliance, the Idaho Energy Council, the Clearwater  Economic Development Alliance, the Idaho Technology Council and the Health Professions Education  Coun cil.     Similar initiatives could b e created around the other categories: industry cluster/firm/enterprise  development,  regional/quality connect place development, and technology development.  There will be  overlap.  For example, talent development is critical for each category.  However, c oalitions could be  created for each category, and their discussions shared with each group to identify those overlaps and  leverage the activities of others.  The University\u2122s role would be to work with appropriate agencies and   groups to develop support for  creating forums around these categories.  We would want those agencies  and groups to take ownership  and work with the Idaho Workforce Council to make appropriate linkages  across each category.  Potential agencies and groups would include the Idaho Departm ent of  Commerce, Idaho Chamber Alliance, Idaho Technology Council, Idaho Association of Counties,

aVUniversity of Idaho Case Study No. 1:   Student Engineering Project Helps Knife Manufacturer  In the fall of 2012, a major piece of knife manufacturing equipment at Post Falls, Idaho -based Buck  Knives Inc. malfunctioned and had to be pulled off the line.  Now, it\u2122s back and working better than ever,  thanks to a group of University of Idaho engineering students who revamped the machine for their  senior project.  Mechanical engineering students Matt Sjoren of Hermiston, Ore.; Brian Bond of Vale, Ore.; Colby Na has  of Alamo, Calif.; Eric Sprague of Las Vegas; and Jesus De La Cruz of Huancayo, Peru, added numerous  safety and efficiency improvements to the machine, which inserts pins into two of Buck\u2122s most popular  knife models.  \ufb01We had a piece of equipment that we  knew could work better, but we didn't really have time to take it  offline and figure it out,\ufb02 Buck Knives President C.J. Buck told KREM -TV in Spokane, Wash.  The UI College of Engineering\u2122s senior capstone design program provided Buck Knives with an  opport unity to receive quality, affordable help from students, backed by faculty expertise. The program  brings together teams of students with sponsors from industry, government and education to put their  engineering skills into practice with real -world projects . Former UI instructor and current Buck Knives director of value stream operations Gary Alvarado  connected the company with the university to solve the problem.  The team solved a major safety issue that was causing knives to pop out of the machine and fixe d  alignment problems that damaged some knives, which then had to be scrapped. They also reworked the  machine\u2122s wiring to make it more user -friendly and installed an infrared sensor to prevent works\u2122 hands  from catching in the machine.  The team also updated  the machine\u2122s process for switching between knife designs. Workers used to  need about 30 minutes to realign the machine when switching models. Now, the process takes about  five minutes, reducing worker fatigue and improving the machine\u2122s efficiency.  Michael Thompson, lead operator for the Buck Knives group that assembles the 110 and 112 models,  told the Spokane Journal of Business that employees had to hand -assemble the knife without the  machine on the line. The re -worked, efficient machine assembles  about five knives per minute.  "We probably produce twice as many knives with the machine as without it," Thompson told the  journal.   The project is Buck Knives\u2122 first collaboration with the university  \u0152 but engineering students contributing  to the economy  of Idaho and the Northwest with their student projects is nothing new. The program has  been in place for decades and continues to grow and increase its connections outside the university.  
p2156
aVSponsors for 2013 senior capstone design projects included Boeing, A vista, Schweitzer Engineering  Laboratory, NASA and multiple Idaho counties and municipalities.   The National Academy of Engineering has recognized the university\u2122s capstone program as one of the  best in the nation, highlighting it as one of seven top capst one programs in a 2012 report.   The program culminates in the annual Engineering Design EXPO, which in 2013 celebrated its 20 th year.  The revamped Buck Knives machine was a major attraction at EXPO, and the team received attention in  the media as well for  its contribution to a local business.  Metrics : CICEP New Metric B.

aVUniversity of Idaho Case Study No. 2:   Economic Development Summit Brings Together High er Ed, State Leaders  In his keynote remarks at the 2012 Idaho Economic Development Summit, Idaho Department of  Commerce Director Jeff Sayer called the state \ufb01a big small town\ufb02 and emphasized the need to work as a   team to build the state\u2122s economy.  Universi ty of Idaho leaders view higher education as a major part of that team  \u0152 hence the Summit\u2122s  subtitle, \ufb01Defining the Role of Higher Education in Economic Development.\ufb02   Working with the state\u2122s seven other public institutions of higher education, the UI hos ted the Summit  and invited  industry  leaders , economic development professionals, government leaders and other  economic development stakeholders to come ready to  discuss  how  public  higher education can best  support Idaho -based economic development now and i nto the future.  The summit was born from the need to better engage statewide stakeholders. In 2010, shortly after  creation of the Office of Economic Development, the University of Idaho sought inpu t from stakeholders  across Idaho using an assessment instru ment developed by the Association of Public and Land -grant  Universities\u2122 Commission on Innovation, Competitiveness and Economic Prosperity.  Participants   responded to questions about the importance of the university\u2122s involvement in economic development  activities and their awareness and evaluation of such activities.  The participants overwhelmingly responded that they thought the university\u2122s involvement was  important  \u0152 but they weren\u2122t aware of it.   The summit allowed for a more personal, collaborative  approach to discussing UI and other institutions\u2122  significant roles in local, state and regional economies.   Before the summit, representatives from each institution and the State Board of Education met   frequently to prepare. Along with regional economic d evelopment organizations, the institutional  representatives encouraged stakeholders across the state to attend the summit.    On Feb. 28, 2012, the summit welcomed 209 registered guests. Keynote speakers outlined the  importance of business, education and in dustry and the need for economic innovation in Idaho.    Summit attendees then broke into small groups to discuss their views on Idaho higher education   institutions\u2122 roles in TRE Networks\u2122 six  areas in which higher education generally has capacity in   suppor ting economic development : talent development, technology development, firm/enterprise  development, industrial cluster development, quality -connected place (community)  development and  regional development.
p2158
aVKey takeaways were the desire for more collabor ation between higher education institutions and all the   stakeholders, for the institutions to be more responsive to economic development needs of all  stakeholders, and for the institutions to better communicate with stakeholders about economic  development  opportunities and outcomes.  Detailed results can be viewed  at  http://idahoeconomicsummit.com/edsummit.php . 
p2159
aVAfter a lunchtime speech from Idaho Lt. Gov. Brad Little, the attendees split into a sec ond set of small -group discussions, this time divided by region.   The participants found that identifying key regional economic development initiatives and higher  education\u2122s role in supporting those initiatives to be much more difficult than identifying o verall  economic development roles, as in the morning session. In most cases, these participants representing  diverse sectors had not worked together to consider economic development needs and opportunities in   their regions.  The hour and 45 minutes allotte d to identifying and prioritizing the potential initiatives  did not provide sufficient time.
p2160
aVThe consensus of all participants was that more regional input from business and industry was necessary   to identify and prioritize the most impactful initiative s.  The Idaho Pathways project, see Case Study 3,  created the opportunity for the more engaged regional strategic planning.    The Pathways Project is the focus of the 2013 Idaho Economic Development Summit, scheduled for  Sept. 30 -Oct. 1, 2013:  http://blogs.uidaho.edu/idaho -economic -summit/ .    Metrics : Economic engagement with a range of stakeholders  \u0152 Of the attendees, 74 were from education, 48  from local, state, or federal government, 33 from  the private sector, 28 from economic development  NGOs, and 2 from foundations.

aV University of Idaho Case Study No. 3:   Collaborative Project Studies Pathways to Economic Growth for Idahoans  With a per -capita personal income and gross domestic pro duct among the lowest in the nation and  wages that dropped the second -most nationwide during the recent recession, Idaho is in need of plans  to boost its economy and improve its  residents \u2122 earning potential.  The University of Idaho\u2122s Office of Economic Dev elopment, the Idaho Department of Commerce,  regional economic development agencies and other stakeholders  have joined together to create the  Idaho Pathways Project  \u0152 a collaborative effort to stimulate successful productivity and prosperity while  positioni ng Idaho\u2122s economy to be more competitive and dynamic in today\u2122s global marketplace.   The Idaho Pathways Project  is gathering  information from Idaho\u2122s six Economic Development Districts  to help each region revitalize its official comprehensive economic development strategy, then create a  statewide plan of action.   The project  seeks to enhance regional economic development strategies by partnering with local  agencies, business owners and edu cational institutions.  \ufb01Stakeholders within the regions will decide what it is they want to accomplish,\ufb02 said Gene Merrell,  associate vice president for economic development  at UI . \ufb01The Pathways Project team can help them  figure out the most effective way  to reach those goals.\ufb02  A team of UI faculty and staff has been traveling the state facilitating the regional planning discussions.   The team described similar statewide efforts in other states, presented data on the regional assets  available to support eco nomic development, and data on the current economic condition and potential  for growth.   These data, when combined with the participants\u2122 perceptions about their region, will help  guide the process of crafting goals, strategies, and tactics.  \ufb01The goal of t he Pathways Project is to help communities make informed, evidence -based economic  development decisions,\ufb02 said Philip Watson, a UI assistant professor of applied economics who is on the  project team.  Broad, statewide themes emerged from the 5 regional disc ussions: Talent Development, Infrastructure,  Leadership, Quality of Life & Place, and Business & Industry Growth/Support/Development.  Strengths,  Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) were identified for each theme.  These themes and  SWOT outputs w ill be the starting points for the statewide planning process that will begin in earnest at  the 2013 Idaho Economic Summit.  The draft regional goals, strategies, and measures of progress will form the basis for discussion about  statewide plans with state a nd regional leaders in business and industry, education, economic   development, and government.     
p2162
aVOver the subsequent three to four months, state and regional leaders will use the regional and Summit  inputs to develop a statewide comprehensive economic dev elopment strategy.   The ultimate goal of the Pathways Project is to leave a legacy of information and action that will  continue strengthening Idaho\u2122s economy, said team member Tammi Laninga, UI assistant professor of  land -use planning.   \ufb01This state needs a  living, breathing, workable roadmap to lead the economic development districts and  the state to economic prosperity.\ufb02   Metrics : Economic engagement with a range of stakeholders  \u0152 Of the attendees at regional meetings, 49 were  from local, state or federal  government, 48 from economic development NGOs, 35 from business &  industry, and 7 from higher education.

aVBold Aspirations , Strategic Plan of the University of  Kansas, Goal 4     The University of Kansas (KU) is a major public research and teaching institution of 28,000  students and 2,600 faculty on five campuses (Lawrence, Kansas City, Overland Park,  Wichita,  and Salina). Its diverse elements are united by their mission to educate leaders, build healthy  communities, and make discoveries that change the world.  KU is a longstanding member of the  prestigious Association of American Universities   and  one o f only 34 public institutional  members   in the association . KU consistently earns high rankings for its academic programs; 46  graduate programs are nationally ranked. KU has 13 schools, including the only schools of  pharmacy and medicine in the state, and o ffers more than  3 7 0  degree programs. The student  population is split almost equally between women and men, represent s   all 50 states and 105  countries ,   and  is   about 15% multicultural. The University Honors Program is nationally  recognized, and KU has produc ed 26 Rhodes Scholars, more than all other Kansas schools  combined .   Bold Aspirations ,  published in  f all 2011 as the   KU  strategic plan for 2012 - 17 , provides   a   template for  the   transformation of  the university .    One of the six goals outlined in the plan was  directed at community engagement through scholarship, partnership and entrepreneurship.    Based on   this framework, KU assembled a team in September 2014  to submit an   application for  consideration as an  APLU  In novation and Economic Prosperity (IEP) University designated  campus .   This designation would recognize and support    n  community  engagement and entrepreneurship.    As an institution we define economic engagement as an adaptation of the Carn egie definition:    mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and resources in a context of partnership and   on engagement and innovation in the strategic  plan. We define innovation as significant new knowledge or solutions  that  when translated have  a meaningful impact on society and the economy.  Economic prosperity is the result of capital

PROCESS EXPERIENCE   Our   approach  in preparing   the  application   for the  University of Kansas   was to utilize our  strategic plan to guide our self - study efforts and demonstrate where we have made  accomplishments to date, as well as  identify  the areas that still require interventions to enable our  university to reach our goals. In Goal 4 of Bold Aspi rations , the university seeks to   1) promote a  culture that openly values engaged scholarship ;   2) encourage, support, and coordinate  s cholarship with a public impact;   and 3) create an environment where an entrepreneurial culture  and vibrant external partnerships can thrive. Thus, we utilized this framework in the design of  our self - study to better understand our performance in the following five areas:
p2168
aV- university interactions   A   ten - person steering committee was formed from the Office of the Vice Chancellor for  Research, Offic e of the Vice Chancellor at KU   Edwa rds Campus,  KU Innovation &  Collaboration (KUIC) , Bioscience & Technology Business Center (BTBC), and the Office of  P ublic Affairs (Appendix  3 ) .   Starting in   October 2014 ,   this committee met 2 - 3 t imes monthly  to   self - study   in economic  engagement   activities    The survey instrument was designed as a modified version of sample CICEP instruments   ( Appendix  1 ).   The resulting instrument looked at 20 separate items in terms of importance and  performance on a 6 - point scale.     The electronic survey was launched via email invitation in  January 2015, and preliminary analysis was presented at a public forum in mid - Febru ary.     Over  50 stakeholders attended the February forum held at the BTBC  in Lawrence , and qualitative data  was captured from these participants in smaller focus groups led by steering committee members  and facilitators.   The  survey  was   sent to  identified int ernal and external stakeholder   groups .  Internally, this  included  all faculty and staff, as well as a sampling of KU graduate and undergraduate students  (approximately 10% of the student body).     External   stakeholders  included membership of both  the   Lawrenc e  Chamber of Commerce   and   the  Greater  Kansas City Chamber of Commerce,  a lumni within a 200 - mile radius of the Kansas City metropolitan area, economic development

aV    5     partners across  the   region, licensees, and industry partners .     A total of 1 , 083 responses were   received: 584 internal (54%) and 499 external (46%).   1.3.     THE ECONOMIC ENGAGEMENT ENTERPRISE    includes growing economic prosperity including  building healthy  communities.  Not only does KU educate leaders that businesses and communities  need, but we  a lso help create the jobs they will   fill and  the  companies  at which  they   will find employment .   KU  is  committed to turning discoveries into jobs and companies and  by  serving as a draw for  businesses . This is k  t element of  Bold Aspirations .   The KU Center for Technology Commercialization (KUCTC) was established in 2008 as the   intellectual property     but this activity was its  only   function.  As a glaring example of why such  a structure was far from ideal, research agreements with industry sponsors were done by 16   largest  two campuses.   KU senior leadership recognized the need to create an organizatio n to lead innovation and  entrepreneurial engagement activities on campus.   With the launch of  Bold Aspirations ,   KU   broadened the scope of our commercialization enterprise and began consolidating corporate  assets under  a  single umbrella.  We created a new  position of Associate Vice Chancellor of  Innovation and Entrepreneurship to head KUCTC, which strongly signaled our new emphasis on  this topic.  Later that year, the Office of Corporate Partnerships   was  created and along with   resources to promote  technolog y transfer and  faculty - driven  startups   was brought under K U CTC ,   directly reporting to the AVC   of Innovation and Entrepreneurship .  The idea behind this  consolidation was straightforward:  By bringing together these previously disparate functions     technolo gy transfer, faculty startup formation, and corporate partnerships     we could position  ourselves to be more efficient and more flexible in pursuing  relationships   with industry partners.   This resulted in a rebranding of   KUCTC to KU Innovation &  Collaboration (KUIC).   T he School of Business and the  BTBC   are  part of  the economic engagement ecosystem  helping  KU fulfill its mission within the region .  The School of Business houses the KU Center for  Entrepreneurship , which was   created   to develop an ent repreneurial mindset among KU students  and faculty. Specifically,  the center works to  develop the knowledge and capabilities necessary  to create and grow products and services that add social and economic value to society. To  accomplish this objective, the   Center for Entrepreneurship focuses on education, research ,   and  outreach programs to provide exper iential learning opportunities.   Through   education courses,  concentrations and certificates are offered for both business students and non - business students.   A ctivities  also  provide  unique   experiential learning opportunities for student teams  who   provid e   regional organizations with venture plans and consulting solutions to address their challenges.

aV    6     These programs are funded from a grant provided by the Economi c Development Administration  of  the  U . S .   Department of Commerce  establishing a University Center at KU  with matching  funds being provided by KU alumni.  KU is one of only 40 universities in the country to receive  this type of grant.   This grant also provides financial support to  other programs in the School of  Business, including  Jayhawk Consulting ,   RedTire ,   the Morris New Venture Business Plan   Competition ,   the  Certificate of Entrepreneurship   for undergraduate and graduate non - business  students ,   and the  KU Entrepreneurship Club .   The BTBC is a unique partn ership among the University of Kansas, City of Lawrence, Douglas  County, Kansas Department of Commerce, and the Lawrence Chamber of Commerce, to support  the bioscience and technology industries in northeast Kansas. By establishing a modern  infrastructure o f talent, facilities, and business support services, BTBC provides tenant  companies     including KU startup companies
p2171
aVwith the tools to form and grow successful  companies.    BTBC is supported by the SBA Growth Accelerator Fund  that   provides capital to  KU  spinout companies and other startups needing capital to scale.   ECONOMIC ENGAGEMENT PLANNING   The IEP process has provided a timely opportunity to generate a detailed  assessment   of the  economic engagement enterprise at KU.  The timing of this   process  was  idea l,   as leadership at  both KUIC and the  Office of the  Vice Chan cellor for Research  has changed in the past year.   With this leadership change has come a new vision  for   building an economic engagement  ecosystem.  As part of this vision, three critical entitie s have come together to collaborate on new  programs:  KUIC, School of B usiness, and BTBC.   This change was in recognition of the  understanding that the  historic ally   disjointed   approach did not maximize expe rtise  nor allow for  growth of the o verall economic engagement  enterprise.  In 2013,  KUIC  partnered with  the School  of Business  to co - fund  an industry partnership position that has enabled collaboration on existing  programs and partnership in building new programs.  In July 2014, KUIC moved i nto the BTBC  facility, and the  close proximity of the groups has created a closer  and more integrated  enterprise.    BTBC and KUIC now jointly fund programs   and events and are  partner s   in economic  development.  These partnerships and the resulting activities   have all been generated within the  last year.  This economic engagement  partnership   has been instrumental in   advancing   KU   in this  important   area.   KU   senior leadership recognize s   the importance of building a culture of entrepreneurship among  faculty and st udents   as noted in  Bold Aspirations .  Prior to 2012, economic engagement was not  necessarily  a priority of KU.   But since the implementation of  Bold Aspirations ,   the institution  has undergone  a culture change .    As programs are developed, we carefully build in events to  educate faculty and students and expose them to how others in their fields  are   partnering with  companies, starting companies,  and  creating intellectual property.    As an example,  KUIC is  
p2172
aV    7     initiatin g the development of  a faculty panel to assist in patent conversion decisions   utilizing  a  transparent process based on uniform data packages.  This process will further educate faculty on  how intellectual property is matriculated and  how the   market   need dr ives investment of  university resources in patent protection .   The IEP process has elevated awareness of the importance of e ngaging external  partners.  This   continue s   to be  crucial to   building an economic engagement ecosystem.  KU has partnered with  the  Kan sas City - based  Pipeline Entrepreneurship   program  to enable   KU to leverage a national  network of business advisers at the forefront of their respective specialties who engage with  Pipeline.  The KU Alumni Association has also become a  key   partner to further extend  our   mentor network.  KUIC has built a mentor database to capture those wanting to give back to KU   , which   directly  involves the community th rough local go vernment and the c hamber s   of commerce ,   has allowed  KU to more directly partner o n   events  creating   synergy   by  integrating   KU  more  into the  community.   1.4.   PROMOTION AND COMMUNICATION   The IEP process provided an opportunity   for KU   to demonstrate to stakeholders t hat  economic  engagement  is a  university priority.  KU identified major  regional  stakeholders as those involved  with the   BTBC,   Lawrence Chamber of Commerce, Greater Kansas City   Chamber of Commerce,  and  Overland Park Chamber of Commerce,  as well as  local economic development officials,  regional alumni, and corporate partners.   The community forum held as part of the IEP self - study  was one of the first interactive discussions  where  KU has engaged  this   broader  community  around the topic of economic eng agement.  Through this forum, it was clear that the community  wanted to be engaged and thought the university had a significant role to play in  regional  economic development.     KU  has   a number of  communication  vehicles to educate the community about univer sity  activities in economic engagement.  Current communications include:  news releases on startup  company creation and new partnerships, an annual report from KUIC, economic engagement  feature  stories produced  by writers in our   KU News   unit ,  KU Discovery  & Innovation   monthly  newsletter from the Office of Research, KUIC external and internal newsletters, and speaking  engagements by the Chancellor and Provost to various groups in  region.   The IEP process has demonstrated that this communication plan should be more strategic and  integrated.  This  will foster additional   partnerships and sustain a plan for economic growth and  innovation fueled by KU.    As part of  Bold Aspirations , the School of   Business, BTBC and KUIC  have come together to globally define the entrepreneurship landscape of programs at KU  and  to  
p2173
aV    8     envision a holistic website to house all of the identified opportunities and resources t hat   support  faculty and student entrepreneurs .     T he Lawrence Chamber of Commerce and the KU Alumni Association are both key partners in  communicating the work the university is doing in economic engagement. We will work with  both entities to develop appropriate external communication s  to their respective   constituencies ,  each of which are   important stakeholders.     The self - study process and the open forum were well received by the community.  This spurred  conversation on continuing networking events to highlight technologies and programs at KU  open to both  internal and external partners.  The idea of  Technology Tuesdays   was developed as  a result ;   these events provide  monthly evening sessions during the academic year to expose  stakeholders to technologies available for license and  to  programs at KU .   Technology Tuesdays   launched in March 2015.    1.5.   ADVANCEMENT OF UNIVERSITY ECONOMIC ENGAGEMENT   The University of Kansas  strives to be a leader in economic engagement nationally.   As  described above, t     To this end,   KU leaders   are active  in  numerous national organizations that work in the field of economic engagement.   KU is active  in the  University Economic Development Association  (UEDA) as KU is an   EDA - supported  University Center   site and as such  hold s   a board seat   at UEDA .   KU is also active in CICEP ,   holding a committee leadership position and actively participating in the implementation team.   Through the CICEP network, KU has had the opportunity to both learn   from ,   and share  with ,   numerous peer institutions best  practices.    A  customer relationship management (CRM) system   implementation to support industry partnerships and marketing of intellectual property was  guided by colleague s at other universities   that already had a system in place.  In turn, the Office  of Co rporate Partnerships at KU routinely takes calls to help other institutions through the  process.    In particular, KUIC is active in the Association of University Technology Managers  (AUTM), University Industry Demonstration Project (UIDP) and  the internally   focused   University Industry Innovation Network (UIIN).  All of these affiliations provide speaking  opportunities to disseminate information, networking to build relationships across universities,  and learning opportunities to better understand other model s and creative solutions .

SUMMARY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS   Accom plishment 1: Education and Work force Development   Workforce development and education accomplishments at  KU include multip le strategic initiative areas.  The KU  Edwards  campus has leveraged the   Johnson County Education  Research Triangle (JCERT)   program  to add 10 new degree  programs for early career professionals.  JCERT  is a unique  partnership of Johnson County (suburban Kansas City),  KU   and Kansas State University   whose  goal   is to create economic  stimulus and a higher quality of life through new facilities for research and additional degree  opportunities. In  2008, Johnson County voters  approved a 1/8 - cent sales tax to fund JCERT  initiatives.  The economic impact of the Triangle in Johnson County over the next two decades is  expected to be well over $1.4 billion and  to  attract millions of dollars in private and public  donations and research grants.   The JCERT - funded  academic programs ,   serve both   the workforce  and the community   development needs of the region ,   primarily in  industries  projected  to help  gro w   the   region.   The Workforce Development Advisory Board  at KU Edwards  critiques and  informs campus administration on academic programs and servic es the campus offers ,   or should  offer ,   to the employers of the region.     This board is an important element in helping to build a  qualified workforce in Greater Kansas City.
p2175
aVKU Continuing Education   (KUCE) , also at the Edwards campus, has longstanding  programs  focused on workforce development   to nearly 30,000 professionals annually   from around the  world .   As an example, t he Aerospace Short Courses is an internationally  recognized   program  that has trained over 3,000 engineers in the aerospace industry.   K UCE also houses the Osher  Lifelong Learning Institute established and maintained through a $ 2M  endowment, and another  $1 00K   in  general  operating funds, from the Bernard Osher Foundation; the institute offers  courses on site across several locations in Nort heast Kansas and South Central Kansas, as well as  in Manhattan, Kansas.   The School of Engineering  Building on Excellence Initiative   is a multi - faceted approach that  drives growth in facilities, faculty, leadership,  research and   students  thereby  help ing   ind ustry  partners find the new talent, designs and techniques they need to fuel economic growth.    Starting  in 2011, KU Engineering has exceeded goals of growing   the number of students graduating with  BS   degrees in engineering   by 60%  through   adding faculty to  maintain a  student/faculty ratio of

Th is   Initiative is supported by  the State of Kansas through the Engineering Growth  Act,  employers, research funding and   additional revenue from growing enrollment.   Certificate programs and internship opportunities are growing at KU provid ing   unique  opportunitie s for students .   Certificate classes also dovetail into degree programs.   As an  example, t he Entrepreneurship Certificate attracts students from across disciplines interested in  starting companies.   This semester o ver 500 students are enrolled in one or mo re  entrepreneurship courses  leading   toward s   a certificate.    KU has a long history in rural workforce development in the healthcare space.   The   Scholars in  Rural Health    program is designed to identify and encourage undergraduate students from rural  Kansas   who are interested in building successful careers as physicians in rural areas. Students  apply for the program in the second semester of their sophomore year in college.  The program  provides assured admission to the  KU   School of Medicine for selected stud ents upon successful  completion of program requirements and graduation from their undergraduate institution.    The  KU School of Medicine is recognized as a leader in the training of rural physicians, ranking 12th  nationally in a recent  U.S. News & World Rep ort   survey. In an effort to provide more doctors for  rural Kansas, the School of Medicine opened a new campus in Salina and expanded its medical  education program in Wichita to a full four years.

aV Accomplishment 2: Innovation and Technology Commercialization   Bold Aspirations  defines how KU values a culture of e ntrepreneurship  among its faculty and  students.  Over the past four years, KU has expanded the commercialization of  its technologies ,  built infrastructure to support corporate partnerships ,  enhanced the culture of entrepreneurship on  campus ,  and built partnerships with businesses ; all of which have advanced   university priorities   by creating   an integrated infrastructure  that   has mitigated barriers and provided  a  faculty - friendly  environ ment .  This infrastructure includes  the  creation of a  P roof of  C oncept (POC)  F und, tool s   to educate faculty about startup creation and licensing, a strong partnership with the BTBC  providin g support for faculty and student startup company creation at KU, and  multiple events  and  venues to network and market faculty  intellectual property   (IP) .    In 2013,  KU began rolling out  this   new infrastructure.   The   POC  F und   was launched  to  competitively award projects in the  intellectual property   portfolio to move them closer to  commercialization.  T he fund has granted t welve awards totaling $600,000 ,   enabled by re - investing royalties from previously licensed  IP .    Education al   programming  was launched ,   including faculty workshops  such as   the Research to Patients  S ummit involving the  s chool s   of  Engineering  and  Medicine partnering with medical device companies.   The Jim Baxendale  Commercialization Award was created as an annual recognition of  a faculty member who has  demonstrated success in commercialization of  his or her   research.  The award is a competitive  process through peer recommendation.  The Technology Tuesday program was launched in 2015  to provide    technology portfolio   with o ver 100 people  in  attendance at   the  inaugural   event.     Since the launch of  Bold Aspirations  in 2012, KU has shown growth in all areas of technology  commercialization.  The number of issued patents increased by 58% from 2011 to 2014 .   The  number of executed license agreements has more than tripled over the same time period.  Licensing revenue has followed suit, increasing from $751,815 in 2011 to $10.68 million in  2014.   New disclosures of  IP   have  also  increased.    A   new in - bound marketing strategy is going  live in 2015 that will integrate   existing tools including a CRM   ( Salesforce )   and   a marketing  platform   ( Hubspot )   allowing a more data - driven, targeted marketing  method   for approaching  potential licensees.   This acti vity and other infrastructure now in place has driven  entrepreneurial   activity  too .  There are now 28 active startup companies based on KU research or capability.   The KU Catalyst , a joint venture of the KU School of Business and the BTBC ,   provides   space,

The BTBC tenant mix is diverse and includes   KU  startups ,  recruited  small to medium - sized companies ,   and   established companies  seeking  proximity   to   KU.   With   three facilities, the BTBC system consists of  over 85,000  sq ft   of office  and  highly flexible and customizable  laboratory space   assisting   tenant s  by access to  business  services.

MCA is a membership - based organization that brings cancer research   and the  care and support professionals together to advance   the quality and reach of cancer prevention,  early detection, treatment, and survivorship in the Heartland. The MCA links the KU Cancer  Center with hospitals, physicians, nurses and patients throughout Kansas and Western Missouri.  The Alliance advances acc ess to cutting - edge clinical trials as well as professional education,  networking,  and  outreach opportunities  to  help   attract and retain top oncology - trained talent  eager to provide advanced treatment in rural areas. A core principle of the MCA is to facil itate  advanced treatment for cancer patients as close to home as possible. In many cases, oncologists  affiliated with MCA Clinical Research Partners will have access to cutting - edge clinical trials  and treatment protocols at their location.     KUCTT is a rec ognized world leader in telehealth services and research   and one of the oldest  and most successful telehealth programs in the world.  Since inception  in 1991, the Kansas  telehealth network has  established  more than 100 sites throughout the state ,  conducted  more than  24,000   clinical consultations for Kansans and hosted hundreds of educational events for health  professionals, teachers, students and the public across the network.    KUCTT  has been an integral  piece of several national and international collaborat ions that have demonstrated the potential of  telehealth to eliminate distance as a barrier to healthcare.

Together, the  community and KU have designed programs to   intervene and improve the caregiving and special  education received by children in this community .  These programs are   funded by long - term  federal grants based in the community and conducted with the active participation of the  community residents.  JGCP' s local partnerships are fostered through its Community Advisory  Board, which consists of Kansas City community leaders, educators, parents, and JGCP staff.  The board gives voices to the community, identifies needs and priorities, and help s   build support  f or collaborative efforts.

Internal stakeholders ranked  the gap in  Institutional Leadership   as the smallest of the  characteristics (high in both importance and performance)   while external stakeholders disagreed .    Conversely, external stakeholders valued Accessibility more than internal stakeholders, which  showed the largest gap score.    In genera l ,   there was convergence of the other  characteristics .
p2207
aVWithin these larger categories, Appendix  2   describes the  items that demonstrated  the greatest  opportunity for growth.  Both internal and external stakeholders identified similar weaknesses   in  performance in   KU providing   1)   a culture of entrepreneurship  (Educational Opportunities) and 2)   an   infrastructure to easily matriculate contracts with industrial partners (Culture).  The third area  of  weakness  pertain s   to how KU articulates strengths and c apabilities internally and externally:   KU maintains user - friendly and searchable web sites detailing faculty and staff expertise and   major economic developmen t players (Accessibility).     While significant advancements have been made the self - study has identified three areas of  growth  that  speak   to   these identified weaknesses :
p2208
aV 3.1 .  Promoting a Culture of Entrepreneurship   As noted,  KU has made improvements in this area since the launch of KUIC in 2011.  Faculty  entrepreneurial   boot   camps    were well received ,   with over 200  individuals  attending.  Interest  among the faculty in entrepreneurship appeared to be growing, but the number of   startup  companies with faculty founders was not increasing.    Faculty feedback  through our quantitative  and qualitative analysis  has assisted envisioning a more comprehensive program to achieve an  entrepreneurial mindset among faculty as identified in  Bold   Aspirations .  Identified barriers led  to  the  development of a   program  that  touch es   on three areas:  exposure of faculty and students to  entrepreneurial successes;  educational programming to understand what it means to start a  business; and infrastructure  to assist in licensing and funding startups.
p2209
aVThe  KU Alumni Association is a strong partne r in economic engagement at KU.  This  partnership  will drive collaboration in  the  development of a seminar series bringing  entrepreneurial Jayhawks back to campus to   tell their stories.    Startup Weekend at KU will  provide a venue for these alumni to serve as mentors and coaches for student - led ideas that can  then feed into the KU Catalyst incubator.  KU  plans to  leverage this exposure programming to  apply for an  I - Corps designation to institutionalize a conceived entrepreneurial training program   into an accelerator program .  This will provide an educational entrepreneurial program using a  model adopted by the federal granting agencies.    Faculty feed back also spoke   to the need to  reduce barriers in the license negotiations.   Development of a quick license for faculty wanting to  start a company with transparent terms  that are  not laden with fees will lessen the burden of  negotiation and provide faculty with an easy ro ute to start companies.  This will all be packaged  into a communications plan that encompasses the entire ecosystem of entrepreneurial  programming at KU identified through the IEP process into an umbrella website that articulates  all the resources for facu lty.   3.2  Ensure Culture of Accessibility to the University   Survey results indicated that KU could improve  its   culture of accessibility  to   external partners   to  drive economic engagement.  Universities are often opaque in   terms of engagement
p2210
aVi.e. ,   how to  identify a partner and who to contact.   Moreover, c ontracting barriers often slow the partnership  further after these first two hurdles are  overcome .  Thus,  KU has taken steps  to become more  transpare nt .     The creation of the Office of Corporate Part nerships centralized development of research  partnerships with KU.   Industry c ontract negotiations  w as   consolidated   across the campuses into  the Industry Agreements Group.  Both , the Office of Corporate Partnerships and  its   Industry  Agreements Group,   are a   part of  the  KUIC umbrella to foster   cooperation   and industry  accessibility .    However, there are still barriers that need mitigation to provide greater  
p2211
aV    21     accessibility.  Both the survey and other qualitative feedback demonstrates that KU needs more  streamlin ed processes for negotiation of industry - sponsored research agreements.  Through  organizations like CICEP and UIDP, KU has looked at other university models that provide easy  contracting terms.  There is a significant need to develop a similar structure at   KU that aligns  with the   strengths and intellectual property commercialization goals.  This will  communicate to corporate partners that KU is responding to their needs and wants to partner in  research relationships.     Research relationships  are an important engagement type, but these are different than broad  community - based partnerships.  A point person for this activity that is embedded at KU Edwards  will drive these types of relationship for KU to increase new community partnerships and dri ve  community - engaged scholarship.     All these new partnerships required a robust tool to search and catalog the research expertise at  KU.  A search expertise portal will be developed that will search KU research and creative  activity portfolio by keyword ,   returning a list of faculty engaged in research in that area and their  scholarly output.  This window into the research enterprise at KU will allow external  stakeholders to easily match need with an expert at KU providing a valuable tool to reach  identifie d goals of providing a culture of accessibility to KU.     3.3 Develop Strategies for KU Leadership to Engage in Economic Engagement    strategic plan  emphasizes   engagement and community - engaged scholarship.  S ignificant  progress toward these goals  has been  limited to strategies focused on  entrepreneurship and  corporate partnerships .     KU is now poised, with support of senior leadership, to develop broader  strategies for economic engagement in the region .  Strategies are required to bridge internal  interest an d community engagement.  Bringing potential and solidified community partners to  the table to assist in crafting a plan to engage the community is essential.  The IEP committee  will be expanded to create an Engagement Leadership board.   This board will be  linked to KUIC  and will carry out the growth and improvement  plan  described  herin ; this plan  will be renamed  and expanded  to be come known as   the KU Engagement Plan.     The Board will collaborate with   Institute for Policy & Social Research (IPSR) ,   whose role  is to  support local economic development organizations through sophisticated research,  analytical business development tools, and strategic planning.  IPSR was designated the Business  & Industry Data Center for the State of Kansas in 2009.  Throu gh this role, IPSR acts to i dentify,  recruit, and manage an affiliate network of nonprofit stakeholders in Kansas who have a role in  economic development efforts or otherwise use diverse economic and demographic data in their  work .    Th ese  capabilities posi tion IPSR ,   and its federally - funded University Center   as  well ,   to  collaborate in     economic impact in the region.   Also affiliated with IPSR is a  NSF - funded  Kansas City - based Census Research Data C enter  (RDC)  located at the Federal  Reserve  Bank of Kansas City headquarters .   The National Science Foundation awarded center is  a  partnership  composed of  KU ,   the University of Missouri, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas

aV    22     City, and the Kauffman Foundation. The RDC allows access to confidential Census   data for a  wide variety of research projects on issues including poverty, crime, employment, education,  entrepreneurship, and health and mortality. As a result, researchers  at KU and across our region  will now have greatly expanded access to federal data  that can only be used at the Census Bureau  or a Research Data Center. The KC - RDC will extend the research capacity and infrastructure at  the University  toward understanding economic engagement  both regionally and nationally .   Commissioning such a report ,   together with the results of the IEP process ,   will provide a  platform for senior administration to engage with external stakeholders around economic  engagement and the university.  This will also provide a venue for information exchange broader  than the  E ngagement  Leadership  b oard to further refine the engagement plan.    Realigning the  web presence of KU in engagement will also provide continuity and another communication  vehicle to this end.

Like  Carnegie, UofL defines economic engagement as the collaboration between  institutions of higher education and their larger communities for the mutually beneficial  exchange of knowledge and resources.   with th e 2008 Carnegie Community Engagement classification and re - designation in 2014 .   Innovation  at UofL  is  primarily  defined by our   institutes and academic programs  developing  solutions to important world problems. UofL implements these ideas by:

aV This strategy has led to significant accomplishments in industry collaboration, innovation  and community development. For example,   UofL is one of 36 universities in the country to be  designated a n   NSF Innovation Corps (I - Corps) Site, one of 16 to receive a Coulter Translational  Partnership Award (CTPA) and one of  three   to be named a n   NIH Research Evaluation &  Commercialization Hub (R EACH).     UofL   is  the  only   universi ty  nationwide  to receive all three   of these  prestigious ,   innovation - associated awards .     These accomplishments are  the result of  a  culture that is   co ntinually seeking to improve  the  innovation infrastructure   at UofL .   The  I EP  process  fit nicely into this culture and  helped  identify  areas for improvement: C ooperative Education,   L inkages with Regional Companies and  C ommunication  Infrastructure .

A   political science   faculty member reviewed  the instrument   for clarity   just  before launch.   The survey was administered electronically over t wo weeks (via Qualtrics)  with a greeting letter from o ur President describing the importance of the study. We had a  respectable  response rate of   about   10%, or 716   responses   from approximately 7,000 surveys sent .  The results were illuminative and are discus sed in detail within the following sections of this  application.     Following the New Metrics  Field Guide, our team identified  and assembled the appropriate data  required to  quantify the myriad  of  ways UofL is economically  engaged.   The offices of technology  transfer, industry engagement,  community engagement,  advancement,  clinical trials and  student affairs , among others,   were key participants in the collection of data.   While we followed  the guidelines as closely as possible, we made some modifications based on  our identity .     A s an example,   t he metrics on student entreprene urship  demonstrate     on  entrepreneurial education ( Table 1) .     The metrics provide  support   for   the  many   anecdotal   examples of student entrepreneurial successes, such as  TNG Pharmaceuticals (TNG), a UofL  student start - up from the entrepreneurship  program that won the 2011 Global Venture Labs  Student Entrepreneurship

aV The Economic  Engagement Enterprise   UofL has a $1.7B annual impact  on the Commonwealth of Kentucky  and contributes   more than   20,000 jobs to the region. These impressive numbers are  largely  the result of our  strategic efforts to be  a  premiere  metropolitan research univer sity.  T he economic engagement  enterprise at UofL consists of three critical aspects:    (i)   community collaboration  to identify university and regional  strengths , such  as  health   care talent and innovation  ( Figure   2 ) ;

aV   To address this issue, we plan to increase the number of innovative cooperative  educational opportunities and make them sustainable.   Reaching this goal will take a university - wide effort and leadership support ,   and this area is being actively   examined by all levels of the  institution, from the administration to the schools to individual departments. Some of the ideas  generated by survey participants are as follows (we have already implemented some of them):     Internal   -
p2370
aVDevelop comprehensive re lationships with major regional employers such as General  Electric, Humana, Ford and Toyota to increase both cooperative education and research.   Establish one point of contact for industry engagement to coordinate university wide  effort to develop cooperat ive educational opportunities to benefit of both industry and  student.
p2371
aV  Use the  Edison   engineering concept of taking degree programs to corporate sites for  larger employers suc h as UPS or Humana.
p2372
aVEach college should reach out to its alumni base.   For example, students in programming  courses could help with small projects within established companies which might then  lead to employment. The graphic design and arts stu dents could work with industry to  overhaul a marketing campaign and receive practical experience.
p2373
aV Develop a full - year capstone course for and aggressively market the engineering students  to work with startups in Louisville. The Hite Art Institute should t rain students in digital  design and work with engineering. Every technology company needs high quality  engineering and design, but this is not happening in the region.
p2374
aVMedical school students could benefit from exposure to industry needs (pharmaceutical  &  medical device s ).
p2375
aV In addition to improving the number of these innovative internship programs, we plan to  better communicate and promote our current efforts in this area. This may be accomplished  through a centralized, administrative office for workforce   development or as part of the current  O ffice of  C ommunications and  M arketing . We have several existing cooperative education  programs that could benefit from expanded marketing and generate funding for similar  programs. Several examples are noted below:     
p2376
aV  College of Business   (COB)     o   MBA Internship  -   The full - time  MBA   program offers an 11 - month paid  internship that helps students identify career options. The COB has partnered with  local  companies,  such as Humana and Republic Bank ,   to develop this exceptional  work opportunity for students .   Before graduation, all students are required to  participate in a capstone consultancy project providing valuable service   to   local  businesses   and organizations .   o   Equine Business Program     The COB has cultivated lasting relation ships with  local equine business firms to provide advantages to enrolled and graduated  students. Employers   including   Churchill Downs, The Jockey Club, the California  Thoroughbred Breeders Association and the International Racehorse Transport  are employers  of EIP graduates.    o   The College of Business Career Development Ce nter curates the COB  Career  Tra k , an advanced development system for students and alumni.  Career Trak   connects students to career counselor appointments, mock interviews with local  firms, inte rnships and full - time employment opportunities. The center holds a  career fair at least annually that draws scores of regional  employers .

aVSchool of Music   o   Career Center  -   The  UofL   S chool of Music & Career Development Center work s   collaboratively to provide  opportunities for  music students to play at  events,  receptions, special occasions, corporate functions, conferences, weddings   and   other distinguished occasions .   The center also helps with job placement upon  graduation.

aV  Louis D. Brandeis Law School    o   Compreh ensive internship program that includes the  Robert & Sue Ellen  Ackerson Law Clinic , the  Samuel L. Greenbaum Public Service Program , a suite  of  clinical externships , a  skills competitions circuit   and an  entrepreneurship clinic   that m atches legal  help with  Entrepreneurship MBAs.     Success with creating and marketing more of these programs can  be  more obtainable than  the more common health or engineering - related cooperative education programs. The most  significant cost would be relationship - building and transp ortation to/from interested business;  metrics for success can resemble our existing job placement figures.
p2379
aVWe learned from the stakeholder s   meeting and surveys that we need to do a better job of   100+ labs, centers and specialized facilities in support of regional economic  advancement.   s ,  Dr. Julia Aebersold, UofL Cleanroom  Manager, urged th at the proper administration and promotion of the research centers would both  increase utilization and improve partnerships. We are now working to accomplish this by  improving linkages with regional companies via the OIE, and we have hired a Director of  Re search Infrastructure who is responsible for working with EnterpriseCorp to facilitate this  goal .

p2382
aV  Several companies, including General Electric, stated that they could greatly benefit from  an easy - to - access listing of faculty expertise and facility capabilities. The Un iversity also  needs a conduit for connecting with those individuals or groups and a plan for cultivating   -  community seeking expertise on any given topic area or specific labo ratory capability.

p2386
aVOperations of the centers and institutes need to be examined and possibly streamlined to  create a  business - friendly environment. For example, websites could be created to  provide explanations of available services including rates and online bill payment  options. Additionally, the Micro/Nano Technology Center has implemented all of these  items, and it h as contributed to the vibrant growth of external business.    
p2387
aV  Develop and execute a marketing plan to support the research brand of the University and  overhaul the research webpage to reflect the marketing plan.     We are incorporating these and other suggesti ons in our ongoing efforts.  For example, w e   -  partners. A centralized support location will increase awareness and utilization of core labs,  offices and centers, and he lp to execute the ideas listed above. This centralized support office  will work with institute directors to develop a five - year plan for core lab collaboration and  cooperation, including development of interdisciplinary research. The plan will include  mark eting, philanthropy, recruitment of both internal and external clients and regional  recruitment of companies  that   may benefit from the core facility. For example, the Director of  Research Infrastructure works with center directors to recruit companies for  location  at   the  Belknap Engineering and Applied Sciences Park (BEASP). BEASP is a TIF development area  that encompasses approximately 987 acres around the main UofL campus. It will include  more  than   1.5M square feet of office and research space. New employ ment is estimated at  more than   3,000 jobs with an average annual salary of $70,000.
p2388
aVAs mentioned earlier, f eedback   we   receiv ed from the stakeholder meeting and surveys  showed a consistent  need to improve our communications and marketing strategy regarding  economic engagement.
p2389
aV The anonymous free - form survey responses provided us with a great deal of information.  Some respondents were not aware of specific programs that we currently have i n place or were  confused on the purpose/nature of such programs.   In order to correct these problems,   we have  developed a strategy that includes the use of a c ustomer relationship management (CRM) system  for managing inte ractions with current and future int erested parties   ( Figure 13 ) .   This includes  both internal parties ,   such as faculty and students ,   and external parties ,   such as industry and  business organizations. This new capability will help us   organize   and  coordinate our   communications (as described abo ve, in the Promotion and Communication section of the  Process Narrative ).
p2390
aV Figure  13 :  After feedback from our surveys, we decided to map the ideal way our communication and  marketing strategy should function and set measurements for tracking progress.   
p2391
aV  50   |  Page     The new strategy will communicate more clearly to key parties how UofL   is making an  impact in every single county in Kentucky through its medical, social, educational,   cultural and  environmental programs   ( Appendix A  -   Travel Guide ) .   We have and are dev eloping  announcements, press conferences, receptions for large research awards, patent awards, invited  presentations, license announcements, student and faculty entrepreneur team promotions and  significant industry - academic - governmental collaboration offer s.   For example, when  Dr.  Suzanne   Ildstad and Dr. Kevin Walsh were recently   named among the new fellows of the  National Academy of Inventors (NAI) , we used all of our outlets to publicize their achievements,  including social media, public press releases, in ternal newsletter articles and an online f eature on  the new research website.     Some of the specific tools we will implement are featured in  Figure  9 .   For example,  Flintbox is widely used by many universities and academic institutions for web posting of  ava ilable technologies and as a channel for marketing communication .   Flintbox postings are  highly searchable by Google and other search engines.   Since our last submission to the IEP in  2014, we have   dramatically  increased the frequency of postings and created     e listened to our business and  community partners and addressed their needs and requests.  Since our  websites  went   live ,   we  have more than doubled the number of  Flintbox  posts  ( since  2013 ).     Our marketing plans now also include targeted technology campaigns and increased  relationships with industry partners. UofL has already increased its direct outreach to regional  companies and is fully committed to continu ing   to do so. In 2013, UofL   participated in the Mid - 
p2392
aV  51   |  Page     Atlantic Science Forum with Novo Nordisk, generating more than a dozen faculty proposals. In  addition, UofL enhanced its relationship with  such  companies  as   Eli Lilly by having several on - site meetings and discussions with industry   representatives to highlight areas of research interest  and possible  collaboration , including through  the  REACH Hub . UofL is actively continuing  those discussions to strengthen relationships with industry. In the near future, UofL intends to  continue and  expand such on - site visits with other national and regional companies. UofL is also  looking into ways to more effectively market to ,   and engage with ,   the local start - up community.
p2393
aVMeasuring success in improved marketing and communications is a challen ge in itself.  We consider the most telling measure would be indirect, in the form of increased number of  partnerships, licensing deals and sponsored research. These outcomes take time and may not  directly source back to our new communication strategy. Howe ver, there are ways to measure  our exposure in between time  such as   using analytics to gauge our social media reach and  monitoring traffic on our new websites. We plan to use this information to better understand  what people want to know but have difficult y finding. For example, we designed  our websites  to  minimize the number of clicks it takes a user to locate   relevant   information and listed contact  information for each staff member in the enterprise.
p2394
aVWe will continue  meeting with  our stakeholders and in corporate their input into our  plans. Most importantly, we will be transparent about plans and have clear procedures to help  clients build expectations of us. We brought into our IEP team several additional key staff  members from relevant units at the univ ersity  who   are helping us implement these goals.

Improving Administration  and Visibility  of Economic Development P rograms:    Administration:     UMD managed the NIST Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) for many years, but as the program  evolved to  require fast turnaround on consulting contracts for specific manufacturing areas, state procurement  regulations impeded quick execution of consulting contracts by UMD. As a result, management of the MEP was  transferred to a more flexible non - profit outside   of UMD .  State ethics laws have also impeded faculty  involvement   from time to time in university technology spinouts. Accordingly, the CICEP Committee  recommends UMD take full advantage of the new   General Assembly   Task Force that will review state ethics  a nd procurement laws and regulations   to suggest reforms that will be considered by the  2016 Marylan d General  Assembly,  allow ing   UMD to more e fficiently and effectively meet   its economic engagement mission.   Additionally we hope these and other reforms will a llow UMD to invest resources in the local community  through developing the Innovation District, adding retail and housing amenities to the UMD Research Park and  attracting more private sector development to the College Park community   Visibility:     The Univ  communications:    The University of Maryland is the state's flagship university and one of the nation's preeminent  public research universities.

Special outreach efforts to these parts of the state should be undertaken, through farm  bureaus, 4 - H and other community stakeholders to help carry the UMD economic engagement m essage.   The University intends to build new strategic communications based on the updated economic impact figures  generated by the CICEP self - study, illustrated with compelling stories of new UMD venture creation for release  sometime in Fall 2015, tied to  a business outreach event.   Establishing Leadership for Econo mic Development and Engagement:    UMD has  well   established programs for engaging indu stry, both local and globally.   As a major research  university located close to much federal activity, UMD is uniquely positioned to create synergies with federal  laboratories, and has done so.  Examples include outreach to federal laboratories like N SF, NIH, FDA, NSA,  NOAA, and Pax Riv er . Engagement with local companies through our unique Maryland Industrial Partnerships  (MIPS) program has led to a stunning economic impact to the state with $ 25B in product   sales, resulting in   6 , 500 new high tech jobs created, and a 40 to 1 return on inv estment to tax payers.     UMD will continue to work with the emerg ing areas it has invested in   biotech , autonomous systems, and  cyber security. It will seek additional federal, state and private sector partners, and will continue building  partnerships across  the state and region, as it has done with autonomous systems.   Just as state governments are considering new partnership models, the federal government is experimenting with  new flexible partnership programs through its federally owned and contractor operat ed laboratories. UMD will  need to expand outreach to these federal labs in Maryland to take better advantage of its location.   The former UMD president heads the National Academy of Engineering in Washington, DC, and a UMD  professor chairs the Government Un iversity Industry Roundtable (GUIR), giving UMD high level access to  suggest better ways to improve university - corporate - federal relations. UMD will foster enhanced engagement  with these and other national organizations   In local economic development, UMD h as hired a former county executive as a campus lead to bring more  private sector businesses to College Park, and we are already seeing results, such as  the recent investment by  Uber of  $25K f or UMD startups, and collaboration with UMD researchers. E nsuring   proper staffing, resources  and coordination to support this critical effort will be important to ensure successful revitalization of the College  Park community.

Additional staff, funding and active collaborations between  innovation units is expected to e nhance   the translation of u niversity research efforts int o useful commercial  products. I nvention disclosures, patents and  new start - up venture activity have   increased in the past few years.    - Corps   program, UMD has partnered with George  Washington University   and Virginia Tech, and recently invited Johns Hopkins University to provide regional  entrepreneurship assistance using the lean launch pad method of customer discovery for universities and feder al  labs .  We expect this activity to significantly e nhance new venture creation; s ignificant staff and resources have  been devoted to support this initiative.    To enhance entrepreneurship education, efforts have been made to inculcate entrepreneurship and i nnovation   established. By establishing the  Academy of Innovation and Entrepreneurship  and dedicating significant  resources to this effort, each col lege will create and execute an entrepreneurship and innovation plan .   The process of self - study and application for this designation has helped UMD clari fy and prioritize these goals.  Entrepreneurship education, community engagement and new venture creatio n have come into focus as major  future goals .  The self - study survey revealed  the  need   for   better communication to  all  parts of Maryland about  the  UMD    role in economic development   -   not just through media outlets in metropolitan areas , but also  through  local media .    Internally UMD is working to leverage existing programs for broader engagement. For example, the OTC  managed an Inventor of the Year program honoring a UMD faculty member with  the  best invention. To bring  more parts of the campus together, a  new award to celebrate the Corporate Connector of the Year was added,  thus celebrating the units on campus that connected with corporations most  effectively , and adding a new  element to the Inventor of the Year celebration.   The  University of Maryland, Balt imore   (UMB) , home of the medical, law and other health professional  programs ,   is also administratively and geographically separate from UMD.   In the last   two years, UMD and  UMB   have consolidated their technology commercial ization offices and created more jo int faculty research  appointments   under the  MPowering the State  Initiative,   e  public research universities.

This budgetary policy change eventually authorized state funding for other university and county  incubators, creating the statewide incubator network, and the Maryland Business Incubator Association (MBIA).   Maryland Techno logy Development Corporation (TEDCO):   UMD developed legislation creating TEDCO,  an award - winning, quasi - public state chartered intermediary to facilitate the transfer and commercialization of   s into the marketplace and assist growth of  technology based business. TEDCO has provided funding and programming support to UMD and other  universities in the state to improve technology commercialization.   $50M Fund Endowed Professorships for State Economi c Development : UMD initiated legislation to create  $50M state appropriated matching fund for endowed professorships in business areas of economic growth to the  state, such as cybersecurity, autonomous systems, and biotechnology.  Loosely modeled on the Geo rgia  Research Alliance model, the Maryland program requires private matching funds from corporations or  individuals, but is only matching program in the country that requires endowed scholars to work with another  university in the state, a federal lab or h elp support university technology startups.   Regional Institution Strategic Enterprise (RISE) Zone:   UMD initiated and then worked with the Maryland  General Assembly to create RISE Zones around universities and federal labs in the state. Targeted property t ax  credits, income tax credits and other incentives are offered to companies located in RISE Zones to increase  number of spin outs from universities to stay in local communities and to attract larger corporations to move into  innovation districts around un iversities and federal lab neighborhoods.

After a brief introduction and explanation of how the  session(s) would be conducted everyone filled out a few   now about UMD.  All participants randomly sat in small groups, and the same three question s were asked at all  of the sessions and in each group, with the emphasis on the particular session topic, and moderated by various  staff members of the University  (one person writing and another collecting  ideas   from the group).  All sessions  were conducted in the same manner.    educating the most promising generation; II) a leader in research, innovation a nd creative endeavors; III) an  economic driver for the State of Maryland; and IV) a critically engaged community partner, and was intended to  collect tangible ideas on what we have now and how we can go forward with those ideas.   The second question,  what   strengths do we have that we can leverage toward achieving our vision of the    particular session topic)   again showcased what we have in relation to our strengths as they related to the topic.   The third question, what do we need to a ccomplish by 2020 to make the 2025 vision a reality, invited everyone  to put forth their ideas of how we envision the University of Maryland in the year 2025.     At the end of the time for the questions, all participants finished the final part of the quest ionnaire: what new  facts/ideas did we learn and how do we see the University going forward?  Moderators were then asked to share  their thoughts and comments of what they had heard in the sessions.   All questionnaires and info are being collected and the dat a will be analyzed and shared with the strategic  planning update group through the month of April. In May the working group will draft the update; in June the  draft update will be put out to the University c o mmunity and ready for feedback.

These include   the Greater Boston Manufacturing Partnership   (GBMP) ,  Massachusetts Sm all Business Development Center Network's Boston Regional Office and  Minority Business Center (MSBDC) ,  the Entrepreneurship Center (EC)  and the UMass  Boston Venture Development Center   (VDC) .     GBMP    mission is to sustain a strong and vibrant regional econo my  through training in  lean and continuous improvement principles.   This   approach  improv es   the operational  profitability and competitiveness of existing and emerging   organizations, large and small,  b y promoting successful  adoption of lean and continuous im provement principles   and  providing  guidance   in investment decisions pertaining to client operations.    The MSBDC  provides free business advisory services and free workshops to Massachusetts businesses  to help achieve these goals.
p2534
aV During FY13, the MSBDC facilitated 13 deals totaling $2.7M in total capital; provided  advisory services to 470 clients through 1,480 counseling hours; facilitated 9 new business  starts and 126 jobs created/retained; maintained its commitment to diverse cli ents with  47% minority - , 14% Hispanic - , and 43% female - owned businesses; and has helped five  clients in four years secure MassChallenge Cash Awards totaling $300K.     The EC  complements and enhances entrepreneurial education at UMass Boston, providing hands - on practice and experience in building start - up businesses and entrepreneurial careers.  Within the EC, we also have the Student Entrepreneurship Program (StEP) which connects  students with paid internships in sales, marketing, software development, quality   assurance, IT support, and finance in many of the best high tech start - ups in Massachusetts.     Finally,  the VDC is  a former university cafeteria converted into  a n   18,000  square foot  business incubator   celebrating its fifth  anniversary this month .

Building a Diverse Workforce     O ur performance  to build a diverse workforce  outweighed   importance    in terms of   st    Our contributions   to the development of  Boston - area young people into positive contributors to our  workforce   are tremendous and unique .  While we are one of many higher education  institutions in the immediate region,  we have provided access to historically underserved  populations since our founding.  This is exemplified through our holistic collaborations with  Boston Public Schools (BPS).  The  u niversity currently  engages  62 different BPS schools  within 88 different prog rams.  We are committed to working with our BPS partners to  provide young students the mos t productive start possible to e nsure post - secondary  success.   It also  is a stepping stone  to building a diverse workforce that is capable of  meeting changing industr y needs.
p2536
aVEssentially,  our local  community is the fabric of the university . T he vast  majority of our  undergraduates live   within a one hundred mile radius   of the campus , and most  remain   in  the  Commonwealth   after graduation.  Moreover, pipeline partnerships with surrounding  school districts  expands    through  programming that   build s   talent prior to  youth  entering  college . The driving force for  collaboration is a shared goal of tr ansforming lives through exemplary teaching and  innovation as articulated in the mission of both   UMass Boston and BPS . Certainly these  partnerships have been a key factor in our success of building diverse talent within our  communities .
p2537
aVNumerous pre - coll egiate programs  leverage partnerships to   support   the majority of its  participants to enter college . Urban Scholars ,   now in its 31 year ,   has worked with middle  and high   school students to enhance their chances of post - secondary success. In the past  three ye ars 100% of the participants entered college and past success show s   that over 90%  will graduate.   Under the   we are   providing   holistic support   through cross - sector collaboration   so  that BPS  students  persist  through  degree attainment. The Institute for Community Inclusion (ICI) has worked to ensure that  people with disabilities have the same opportunity to dream big, and is piloting the  Inclusive Concurrent Education Partnership to support high school students with  di sabilities  as they transition   to post - secondary education and the workforce.
p2538
aV  Another success factor is the development of new resources and programs that improve  retention by enhancing student engagement opportunities and align our focus areas with  indu stry needs.  Freshman Success Communities  (FSC)  within the College of Math and  Science indicate drastic improvements in persistence among its students and prepares

With IT education so critical to the innovation  econo my, BAT E C creates a seamless regional IT education - to - workforce pathway system  that attracts, supports, and advances a diverse population of technology students who are   Depa rtment, today this seamless system has served over 8,000 students encompassing 30  school districts, 7 community colleges leading to BS and MS degrees in IT and many minor  degrees at UMass Boston. Working with its private sector advisors     Google, Microsoft ,  Cisco, and Raytheon, to name a few     it is addressing the  all - important   workforce  preparedness dilemma. This program is playing a critical role in creating opportunities for  students to fully enter this competitive workforce/entrepreneurship of the innov ation  economy.     A third success factor is scalability   of our partnerships and programs . The FSC reallocated  existing resources to build its program and  is reaching   over  half of all CSM majors   this year .   and   operates in  San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Chicago.  These regional IT pathways are sharing best  practices and learning from each other.     wit h BPS  seeks to raise student achievement in science,  significantly improve the quality of science  teaching in K - 12 and university settings, and increase student success in higher - level  science courses and admittance into university science and engineering  programs.  A new  iteration of BSP is now   reaching new school districts in greater Boston  and   New Jersey.

aVResearch partnerships like this one   have   considerable overlap with  student internship  opportunities, a growth area identified in   this process, because  the training opportunities,  especially for   u nder - represented  minority (URM) students , are building the next  generation of scientists . Meanwhile, these students  contribut e  their own knowledge and  experiences as assets to projects.  The integration of students into research is one of our  success factors and aligns with   university priorities. It also has direct  connections to  the  various  innovations in student success programming   and   educational offerings (e.g. STEM)   happening at the university.

aVThe  integration across disciplines within our research is also leveraging  a diverse set of  academic perspectives to deal with complex issues. For example, a faculty member in  gerontology explored stress levels among medical interpreter providing cancer care; and a  professor of public policy examined  the relationship between fina ncial stress and cancer  treatment. Further, research partnerships enable entry level faculty to develop into  respected leaders, eventually serving as principal investigators on projects.     The depth of the DF/HCC partnership   and research partnerships in gen eral have   resulted  in many   other   positive  economic  outcomes. The Center for Personalized Cancer Therapy  (CPCT) was established in   2013   with $10.6M from the M assachusetts   Life Science Center.  $40   million   in additional funding beyond the initial NIH awards has been leveraged, and   The DF/HCC - UMass  Boston partnership also played an important role in the creation one of the most successful  a ccelerator facilities in greater Boston     the  aforementioned  Venture Development Center.

Success Boston   Success Boston was launched following a 2008 study finding that only    - mayor challenged  the city to double the  college completion rate for Boston public school  (BPS) graduates, which led 37 Massachusetts colleges and universities to  accept the invitation of UMass Boston Chancellor J. Keith Motley, co -  ative. The  partnership between colleges and nonprofit organizations provides  comprehensive support and wraparound services to BPS students and  graduates so students persist through the obstacles that inevitably stand  in the way of degree attainment.   2008  -   Present   External Partners:   47  Faculty:   7 per year on  average    Funding:   The Boston  Foundation, 2009 - 2014    649 BPS graduates currently being supported through the program at UMass  Boston; current BPS students are also participants and not included in this n umber.  Results are showing consistent progress as measured by persistence and  performance: 2012 cohort on track at the end of first year (defined by minimum 2.5  GPA/24 credits/six - year graduation) increased to 53% from 42% in 2011, 41% in  2010, 36% in 2009 , and 26% in 2008. At the same time, the percentage of students   -  22% from 45% for 2008. In terms of year - to - year retention rates, Cohorts Three and  Four have made significant  gains from first - to - second year (89% and 87%  respectively) as compared with Cohorts One and Two (80% and 79% respectively).  Second - to - third year data shows a major improvement in Cohort Three in relation  to the first two cohorts  79% continued into the thir d year compared to 64% and  65% respectively (data not yet available for cohort four). Students in Cohorts One  and Two had a 57% and 56% retention rate between the third and fourth year  (Cohort Three data not yet available). Students in the program were fou nd to have  retention rates more than 20 percentage points higher than peers who did not  participate. At a systemic level, an intensive planning process brought together  more than 200 individuals across the network to address key barriers including  contextu al issues on -   and off - campus that affect the academic success of BPS  graduates.   Center for  Collaborative  Leadership,  Emerging Leaders  Program (ELP)   ELP is an executive training program for professionals in the Greater  Boston area. Corporate, nonprofit,  and public sector organizations  nominate mid - level, high potential rising leaders within their ranks to  participate in a ten - month leadership development program aimed at  enhancing individual leadership skills and ability to work effectively with  others to ward significant civic goals.

The partnership is achieving this goal  through the development of a  robust Cancer Outreach Program that  integrates research with culturally responsive prevention and  educational activities; continued development of rigorous, collaborative  cancer and disparities - related research; and expansion of the cancer  training opportu nities for under - represented minority (URM) students,  fellows, and scientists.   2002  -   Present   Internal Partners:   7  university units    Students:   31   Faculty : 33 faculty  Funding:   $13.7 million (2010 - 2015)  from National Institutes of  Health, U54 Minority  Instit ution/Cancer Center  Partnership Grant; $10M  from Massachusetts Life  Sciences Center   Since initiating the U54 in 2010, research funding received by UMass Boston  increased by 16% ($49.6M to $57.3M in 2013). This funding has expanded capacity  in three cores.  The Training Core is increasing the number of UMass Boston  students, particularly those from under - represented minority backgrounds (URM),  who are interested and well - trained in cancer disparities research. The Survey and  Statistical Methods Core (SSMC) is   a collaboration that integrates the capabilities of  existing UMass Boston and Dana Farber Cancer Institute resources to support  collaborative research and career development of junior faculty members. The  Outreach Core aims to maximize the dissemination a nd implementation of  evidence - based strategies to promote cancer prevention behaviors in faith - based  settings, provide training opportunities for students in outreach research, and offer  resources and support to U54 new and ongoing research projects.

aVCommunity engagement is a common thread throughout the U56/U54 Partnership.  CRUZA, the Alliance for Latino Health through   Faith and Action, is an example of a  research partnership that expanded beyond DF/HCC and UMass Boston. CRUZA  engaged the Boston College School of Theology and Ministry and 34 Latino parish  communities throughout Massachusetts. CRUZA also enlisted 18 UMas s Boston  students, all bilingual in Spanish, to play integral roles in parish recruitment, cancer  education and program evaluation.   Center for Social  Policy   The Center for Social Policy (CSP) creates avenues of understanding for  social issues, building  organizational capacity to improve planning,  processes, and partnerships. CSP believes that "to build knowledge from  the ground up" constituent engagement in research must illuminate the  realities faced by families living in poverty, in a language and form at that  policymakers and practitioners can understand. CSP has served as a key  partner in multiple initiatives in Boston focusing on leveraging models of  collective impact and collaboration to address structural causes of  poverty. Projects have addressed a reas that fall under community  development, such as housing and homelessness, healthcare, education,  and employment. The interconnectedness of many of these initiatives  cannot be ignored due to the fact that partnering organizations are  participating in mu ltiple efforts with overlapping outcomes and findings  informing systems - level and policy change. For instance, Project Hope  has been part of multiple collaborations with CSP on projects related to  housing stability, wrap around services for education, heal th and  workforce development, and place - based programs.

Broadly disseminating information about university - community and university - industry collaborations.   2.   Actively encouraging faculty assistance and research collaborations with industry.     3.   Providing structured experiential learning opportunities to students through  innovative internships and co - op experiences across a wide range of academic  programs     These finding s   validate areas that we have begun to address as our write - up will present.

Broadly disseminating information     O ur survey results indicated that our primary area for growth relates to better    - identified goal to promote our active involvement with business groups,  nonprofits, and government. To   begin to address this opportunity , on Sunday May   11, 2014  UMass Boston  launched a very bold media and marketing campaign that aligns with our  upcoming 50th anniversary year of celebrations.   It is designed in a way that seeks to create   to communicate  with a broad audience of stakeholders who need to have a fuller understanding of the  quality of our teaching and research as well as the excellence of our faculty and students.

The online  course, developed by UMass Bos ton, will teach students fundamental sales,  marketing, and product development, skills which are highly coveted by small  startup companies. In addition, students will learn what a startup is looking for in an  intern, how students can present themselves to  potential employers, and once hired,  how interns can prove themselves to be useful and adaptable employees. Students  from public higher education institutions including UMass Boston, Bunker Hill  Community College, and Roxbury Community College will partici pate in the  program. This program is built on the success of a three year program that places  UMass Boston students in start - up entrepreneurial companies in the VDC. To date,  150 students have been selected for paid internships.

In 2012,  UMass  Lowell   opened an 84,000 sq. ft. , $ 84M   advanced research facility, the Saab Emerging  Technology & Innovation Center.   This LEED Gold Certified - facility adds significant  research capacity, including  Class 100, Class 1000 and Class 10,000   cleanroom spaces,  biomaterials and wet lab facilities,  engineering lab space, and plastics processing high bay  facilities. However ,   this is not simply an academic research facility ;   it is meant to support the  needs of our industry partners. In order to improve partner access to this and our other core  research facilities, the Office of the Vice Provost for Research put all of these facilities online  in a way that supports partner acc ess.

O n May 1 of this year the University hired an Executive Director for UMII - Lowell , Dr . Wayne Johnson .  UMII - Lowell  demonstrates our  commitment to building deeper  relationships that serve the need of industry, the University and our community.   The basic  structure for all of   these examples is replicable.   For example, the WindSTAR  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center has been replicated for many topics  nationally.     Others, such as our new co - location model and Core Research Facilities, depend  on  having  a  critical mass of faculty expertise and unique technical facilities for University - Industry partnerships. One key aspect is providing technical expertise and facilities that may  be too expensive for a company to justify as an on - site, full - time nee d, but is critical for the ir  technical competitiveness.  Another important benefit is ensuring regular (including informal)  interactions, versus just an annual meeting to enhance more connections (and more  innovative ideas) across the campus.     All such effo rts require good leader s   and a core  leadership group to keep things moving forward.

M2D2 offers 14,0 00 sq. ft. of  incubator space , including wet  labs, collaboration space, meeting space and private office space.    Established as a grant - funded program without space in 2008, M2D2  originally  focused on  assisting medical device companies to develop an early stage prototype that would in turn  assist these startups to secure investment funding.  However ,   as the program grew it became  clear tha t many medical device startups needed assistance beyond prototyping in order to  establish and grow their comp anies. In 2010, M2D2 secured $4M  in state funding to develop  incubator space in the Wannalancit Mill complex in Lowell.  This space houses 15 medic al  device startups .    S ince its founding in 2008, M2D2 has worked with over 55 medical device  companies. With M2D2    assistance ,  these companies have raised over $41 M in private  investment funds   and  $7M  in federal and state grants, and contribute to the dir ect and indirect  employment of  nearly 200   people. The success of this effort was recently recognized by the  Massachusetts Life Sciences Center, which awarded M2D2 another $4 M   capital grant to  add   11,000 sq. ft.  of  incubator space.    in incubating medical device  companies   has attracted other types of  startup companies to our ecosystem.  Clean - tech, materials and robotics companies have  contacted M2D2 and University staff, requesting incubation and startup space.  For the past  year, Uni versity staff    have explored options and funding mechanisms to address this need.  Ms. Nancy Saucier, Director of New Venture Initiatives, and Dr. Steven Tello worked  closely together in the development of a space that will meet this need. On April 24 ,  2014,   Mass.

The Innovation Hub will help entrepreneurs and early - stage ventures in testing products and business concepts, developing prototy pes, raising  funds and launching high - growth businesses. This facility will provide much - needed  space  for startup companies, expanding beyond the medical - device industry by supporting startups  in the robotics, flexible electronics and clean tech sectors.  Like M2D2, the Innovation Hub  will  use   a business model that includes lease revenues from tenants, corporate sponsorships ,   and revenues associated with the delivery of needed product and business development  services.   A n additional $400,000 in startup sup port is anticipated from the Executive Office  of Housing and Economic Development.   The University also actively contributes to the broader discussion and growing body of  knowledge regarding the development of the entrepreneurial university. UMass Lowell, i n  collaboration with the Deshpande Foundation and other key institutions, is a founding partner  of the Deshpande Symposium on Innovation & Entrepreneurship in Higher Education 7 . This  seminal conference gathers faculty, administrators, entrepreneurs and rel ated development  professionals annually to examine entrepreneurship in the curriculum, technology transfer   rd   annual conference, hosted at the UMass Lowell Inn & Conf erence Center in June, is expected  to attract over 200 participants and presenters from across the US and Canada.

Long - standing  partnerships become   quasi - institutional in character and can produce even greater yields in  their results (quantity and quality) because of the deep understanding that develops between  partners.    We have a record of investing programmatically and financially in key partnersh ips that have  become signature collaborations, even award - winning ,   as seen in the UMass Lowell String   9 . This  initiative  plays an integral role in our community by bridging the gap after music education  was deeply cut  in   the curriculum  of   Lowell    p ublic  s chools. The String Project  serves   students from economically challenged neighborhoods in Lowell. Many of  the    fa milies cannot afford the tuition fees or provide their own instruments.  With support from  UMass Lowell and generous  community sponsors , we offset the cost to participants by  offering scholarships and subsidizing instrument rental fees.

aV I.   Improve Communications with Internal Constituents   While the University has done an admirable job in promoting and communicating information to  external stakeholders regarding university - community collaborations, university - industry   ovation and economic  growth, internal stakeholders (faculty, staff,  and,  students) suggest that improved communication  regarding these activities would be of value.     As part of  our survey analysis , we learned that  external and internal stakeholders agree t hat communicating this type of information is of high  importance;   however external stakeholders are twice as likely as faculty   and staff   to   rank  University performance in these areas highly. The Committee was surprised to find such a  difference in perspect ives between stakeholder groups and plans to examine this more closely  over the next year in order to develop specific recommendations for improvement.   The Committee proposes the development of several objectives that will ultimately assist the  University  in improving communications to internal constituents. Fortunately, the Executive  Director for Public Affairs is a member of the Committee, and is in a position to assist in  developing and impl emen ting recommendations.   Working closely with the Office of Uni versity Relations and other campus offices, the  Committee will examine the various methods used by the University to communicate this type of  information to both stakeholder groups.

Finally the Committee will publish a

II.   Review and Deve lop Awareness around Incentives that Support Engagement in  Economic Development Activities   An expanded focus on high - quality research, the addition of new masters and doctoral - level  degree programs, industry interest in custom education programs and resear ch partnerships, and   have all combined to increase requests of faculty and staff to work on outward - facing projects,  taking them off campus and into local comm unities and businesses.  The University has taken  some significant steps toward addressing these new demands including the expansion of tenure - track faculty in high - growth programs, the introduction of a non - tenure track lecturer position  that focuses more   on teaching and service, and the hire of new staff into areas of strategic  importance (e.g., Co - op & Career Services, DifferenceMaker, UMII). However when the  Committee on Economic Development, Entrepreneurship and Corporate Relations reviewed the  Univers  analysis  in relation to external economic development activities in Fall  2013, a common theme emerged across the working groups  -    importance to the region in supporting economic development activities has increase d, it has  become more difficult for faculty and staff to meet this demand. While a majority of both  internal and external stakeholders view a high level of external engagement as important to very  important, Committee working group members and survey respo ndents suggest it is time for the  University to review policies and incentives that support faculty and staff engagement in  economic development activities.   Toward this end, the Committee proposes the following objectives:

Develop draft recommendations meant to support faculty and staff awareness of, and  participation in, economic development activities.     III.   Improve   Access and Entry   for External Partners to People, Knowledge and  Facilities that Support Economic Development Activities and Engagement   As outlined in the Areas of Accomplishment, the University has significantly grown facilities,  faculty, staff and programs over the past five years to best meet the increased and emerging  economic development needs of the region. We have hired new faculty  and staff and developed  new offices and program. As we have grown, we have brought new partners, businesses and  communities into our economic development ecosystem.  However our stakeholder survey data  and the Committee working group SWOT discussions sugge st that it is sometimes difficult to   internal and external stakeholders feel quite strongly that user - friendly, online portals and  websites are important in con necting with University faculty, staff and R&D resources (72%,   in this regard (21%, 38%). This sentiment was echoed by the Committee SWOT analysis, which  found t hat it was sometimes difficult for external stakeholders to identify areas of research  expertise, and to connect with the University faculty and resources that best meet their needs.   
p2668
aV    APLU CICEP Innovation and Economic Prosperity  University     UMass Lowell  Submission   May 12, 2014     Page  28   of  32   While external stakeholders and Committee members acknowledge and value  the infrastructure  the University has developed to support new collaborations and long - term partnerships, they also  suggest the policies for accessing these resources were often unclear and cumbersome.    These findings are not unexpected, the University has   experienced substantial growth in people  and resources over the last several years and must now develop policies and processes that  facilitate and support access to these new and varied resources. The Committee proposes a  process that engages both interna l and external stakeholders in researching the problem and  designing potential solutions.   1.   Identify key internal and external constituents engaged in, or supporting, economic  development activities and related resources at the University.   2.   Convene a represen tative subcommittee that examines the way various economic  development activities and related resources are cataloged and promoted by the  University.    3.   Examine University policies guiding external access to and use of facilities that support  economic  development.   4.   Examine policies and practices at peer institutions that support external access to faculty  expertise, facilities and programs related to economic development activities.   5.   Develop draft recommendations regarding how to best promote external acc ess to  University faculty and facility resources that support economic development.

aVProcess Narrative  Introduction  The University of Memphis ( UofM ) is representative of a set of higher education institutions whose  growth and development is best understood within the context of the past 50 years.  Located in an  urban setting, the  UofM  experienced rapid growt h in enrollments in the 1960\u2122s and 1970\u2122s to its current  enrollment of 22,500 students.  Simultaneously, it has shifted its mission over the past 20 years from   principally being a teaching institution to a teaching -research university.  It is a Carnegie hi gh research  activity university  and has been designated by the Tennessee General Assembly as one of the state\u2122s  two research universities.    That background is important in understanding the  UofM \u2122s contributions to innovation and regional  economic developm ent.  As a teaching institution, it has always played an important role in providing  educated manpower for the region\u2122s economy.  However, it is relatively \ufb01young\ufb02 in serving as a research  partner to the area, and that \ufb01youth\ufb02 helps to identify its meaning  of innovation and economic  prosperity.  For one, it does not have a long time history of being embedded with the major regional  industries of the past such as cotton and heavy manufacturing.  However, being \ufb01new\ufb02 has translated  into opportunities for true  innovation.  The  UofM  is intentionally and systematically aligning its  instruction, research and outreach to current and emerging economic drivers in the region.  And as  evidenced in its case studies, it is creating new forms of building connections to en able that innovation.   The examples in the case studies involve recent initiatives, but each is a reflec tion of innovation in itself  and is realizing quick demonstrable results.  Certainly economic prosperity is linked to the production of goods and service s in a community.  And  many of the  UofM \u2122s activities are directly involved in the discovery of new goods and the development  and application of efficiencies in the delivery of goods and services.  However, the  UofM \u2122s definition of  prosperity goes beyond ju st production.  It includes the quality of life of the persons in our community  and region.  That means that economic prosperity includes the physical, social, emotional and civic  health of all citizens.  That is why one of the report\u2122s case studies is tit led, \ufb01Strengthening Communities:  Putting Community Back in Economic Development,\ufb02 a description of engaging all aspects of economic  prosperity in innovation and economic prosperity.  Process Experience  The Innovation and Economic Prosperity Award and Recogn ition (IEPAR) program has occurred at a  particularly opportune time for the  UofM .  As a new or emerging urban research university, the  UofM  has already been going through the process of self -assessment of how to best link with regional  economic development .  Since the initiation of the award process, two leadership changes have made  the timing of the program even more important.  In March 2013, the University hired a new Provost, Dr.  David Rudd.  On July 1, Mr. Brad Martin began serving as interim  president following the retirement of  Dr. Shirley Raines.  Moving the  UofM  to support regional economic development was a priority of the  
p2696
aVprior president and provost.   With  the two new leaders coming from business backgrounds th e focus has  become an even higher priority.  Two assessment processes have been underway in 2013.  One, sponsored by the UofM\u2122s Office of  Research Support Services, was an internal evaluation on the UofM\u2122s support structures for sponsored  research.  Since some of the U ofM\u2122s economic development activities are in the form of sponsored  research, that assessment was helpful  to point to improvements for infrastructure to assist economic  development.  The other was the IEPAR program.    The UofM followed a three step asses sment process for  the IEPAR  program.  The first  was to gather  perceptions of important roles for the  UofM  in economic development and  the  assessment of the  performance of the  UofM  in those roles.  To get those assessments, the  UofM  used the APLU -CICEP  Internal and External Assessment Tools for Regional Innovation and Economic Growth.  For the internal  participants, Deans of the  UofM  colleges were asked to identify faculty and staff members within their  colleges who they perceived as involved in or  were expected to be directly involved in economic  development related activities.  Of the 58 persons identified as a result of the request, 40 (69.8%)  responded.  Four different clusters were identified for the external survey.  Two focused on two  importan t industry clusters in the  UofM  region, the biomedical industry and technology.  One focused  on elected officials and government administrators.  The fourth was a sample drawn from the Greater   Memphis Chamber of Commerce.  That produced a population of 28  with 18 respondents (64.3%).    The second step was to conduct a series of group interviews aimed at identifying recommendations for  improvement.  A gap analysis of the survey results was performed identifying indicators in which the   difference between the  assessed importance of an item and the performance of the  UofM  was greater  than 50%.  Participants in the interviews were presented the survey results, the gap analysis and then  asked to make recommendations for improvements.  The internal groups included  a session with the  college deans and three separate groups of internal researchers.  The internal groups were grouped  according to how they were surveyed, industry clusters, public officials, and Chamber of Commerce.    The final step was to set out the rec ommendations and forward them to the University administration.   The Description Improvement Area Summary Table provides the list  of recommendations  and actions  from the internal and the IEPAR reviews.  Economic Engagement Enterprise  The University of Memph is is committed to the economic and community engagement of its faculty and  students with the community.  This commitment is expressed in the mission, values and the strategic   goals of the University of Memphis ( http://www.memphis.edu/stratplan/ ).  The vision  of the University  states that  it  will be \ufb01recognized as one of America\u2122s great metropolitan research universities, noted for  its innovative academic programs and for capitalizing on its urban setting an d region to address the  challenges of our global society.\ufb02  Engagement is at the core meaning of a metropolitan research  university as they are distinguished through their connection to their urban setting to address social  
p2697
aVchallenges, expand economic deve lopment and provide significant community based experiences for  students.   This institutional priority permeates the organization  and  guided decisions such as the partnership with  the  FedEx Corporation to build the FedEx Institute of Technology, establish  research centers , th e Office  of Technology Transfer , and the Crews Ventures Lab, a start -up  incubator . One example of how the emphasis on engagement impacts faculty is contained in the tenure and  promotion guidelines.   Engaged scholarship  is an evaluation criteri on  and supports a shared definition of  engaged scholarship across the institution, consistent with the co mmonly held definitions of  engagement by the Carnegie Foundation, Kellogg Foundation, and the American Association of State  Colleges and Universities.  The university\u2122s definition of engagement is defined as follows:  \ufb01Engaged scholarship  now subsumes the s cholarship of application. It adds to existing  knowledge in the process of applying intellectual expertise to collaborative problem -solving with  urban, regional, state, national and/or global communities and results in a written work shared  with others in  the discipline or field of study. Engaged scholarship conceptualizes "community   groups" as all those outside of academe and requires shared authority at all stages of the  research process from defining the research problem, choosing theoretical and methodo logical  approaches, conducting the research, developing the final product(s), to participating in peer  evaluation. Departments should refine the definition as appropriate for their disciplines and  incorporate evaluation guidelines in departmental tenure an d promotion criteria.\ufb02  In concert with the faculty tenure and promotion process, the University of Memphis, its Alumni   Association and the Tennessee Higher Education Commission (THEC) sponsor five different community  engagement recognitions and awards.  On e of these awards, the Faculty Award for Excellence in  Engaged Scholarship, is equivalent to the highest teaching and research award that the University offers.  Economic development and community engagement activities range  from  partnerships in economic  de velopment programs, to administrators  and faculty serving on governing boards, community  redevelopment where students serve as consultants and supporting innovative startup companies via  the Center for Entrepreneurship .  For example, the former president, Dr. Shirley C. Raines, served as  President to the Greater Memphis Chamber of Commerce. Through the UofM\u2122s work  in the community,  university economic engagement h as become real to both the people and organizations that  it serve s and the University of Memphis faculty, staff and students.   The  UofM  has been recognized by the  Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching for  its  curricular engagement and outreac h and  partnerships and by the President\u2122s Honor Roll for Community Service for  its  service to the community.   In spite of the se strides, the CICEP assessment process has highlighted areas where the University  continues to face challenges in implementing it s community engagement enterprise.  The survey  revealed  strengths in  creat ing  and encourag ing  innovation and partnerships, creat ing  professional  development opportunities,  and  assert ing   institutional leadership  for economic development. .  However, it iden tified areas for improvement including  the internal support structure,  openness and  
p2698
aVaccessibility to university resources, and communicat ing  of successes, achievements, and opportunities  for collaboration.  Economic Engagement Planning  The University of M emphis has experienced a change in administration as a new president and provost  have taken over these leadership roles.   Goals for the  UofM  are to build on the momentum established  by the previous leadership and intensify our engagement in the community.   An  overarching  goal  is to,  \ufb01bring the university to the community and the community into the university.\ufb02  The University of Memphis currently engages in multiple assessments involving internal and external  constituents to gauge the university\u2122s invo lvement with the community and the effectiveness of the  academic programs to meet the workforce needs of the community.  These processes include: an  engaged scholarship faculty survey that assesses the extent of engaged scholarship across the  university, a  regular survey of employer satisfaction with graduates, employer advisory groups for  colleges and programs, an  employer  focus group process intended to identify characteristics and skills  that local employers consider important, and a research capacity a ssessment to identify policies,   procedures and practices  affecting  faculty  members\u2122  ability to successfully pursue sponsored research.  The CICEP external and internal assessments  were  valuable additions  to augment  the  existing planning  tools.    The assessments and focus groups initiated by the University of Memphis indicate  three  areas for  improvement , changes in the internal infrastructure to encourage and reward multidisciplinary work  teams, enhancing  access to university expertise , and  more tar geted and strategic  workforce  development.   Connection to community is already an explicit part of the UofM\u2122s mission.  Adoption of a  new management model  in AY 2013 -14, Responsibility Center Management, which ties rev enues and  expenses to an academ ic unit  will augment economic development in two ways.  Economic  development research and outreach partnerships are revenue opportunities.  Curriculum addressing  regional economic development needs leads to  increased  student enrollments and unit revenues.  The  Uo fM will adopt incentives in tenure and promotion, indirect charges, and information sharing for the  formation, recognition and rewarding of economic development focused interdisciplinary work teams.    An electronic data base allowing researchers to learn of  one another\u2122s work will assist in the  development of teams.  External reviews of projected employer human resources and research and  outreach needs over the next 10 years will form the basis for long term sustainable planning.   Promotion and Communication  The University of Memphis relies on multiple strategies to  promotes its  economic engagement  accomplishments and  goals.  Strategies  include di stribution of promotional materials to the general  public via traditional and social media outlets, targeted communications to external community and  business constituents based on recommendations of on -campus experts, sponsorship of regional  economic deve lopment and innovation workshops and conferences, presentations at professional  
p2699
aVconferences, and frequent in -person discussions with the leadership of for -profit corporations, non -profit organizations, public administration, and neighborhood associations.  One of the means in which the University of Memphis communicates its story to its internal and external  constituents is through its Marketing and Communications Division.  The division is responsible for  maintaining the university website, soliciting infor mation to develop press releases for release to the  traditional media and the publishing of a quarterly magazine  distributed to all alumni and friends of the  university,  promoting  research, innovation and economic development outcomes and other stori es of  interest to alumni and regional constituents.  As an example of  its  ongoing communication with internal  and external constituents, the most recent edition of the  University of Memphis Magazine  contains  articles about the University\u2122s internship program, technology transfer initiatives, non -traditional  student\u2122s degree completion, and tutoring and mentoring of disadvantaged youth.  These articles focus  on various aspects that support regional ec onomic development.  Additional examples of technology  innovations and the support of workforce development can be found on  its  Features Archive  webpage.   Although the University has a system in p lace to develop promotional materials for dissemination to  internal and external audiences, focus group participants indicated that they were not aware of many of   the initiatives of the  UofM .  Recently, the newly hired Provost has facilitated reorganizatio n within  Academic Affairs to facilitate communication processes across the institution and into the community.   Information Technology has been brought under Academic Affairs Division and the Office of Institutional  Research has been reorganized with expan ded responsibilities to centralized data reporting.  These two  units, along with the Division of Marketing and Communication, will develop systematic processes for  more effective collection, maintenance and communication of information to our stakeholders.    The identification of stakeholders for inclusion in decision -making takes place during the academic  planning review process.  Each of the colleges, schools and departments are required to identify their  community partnerships and connections and express  their impact on the economic development of the  region within their area of study.  As a result, internal stakeholders are identified via the annual   academic planning process.  Internal stakeholders are also identified through the engaged scholarship  surv ey and grant applications processed through the Office of Research Support Services. External  stakeholders are identified via internal experts, community leadership organizations, alumni association  records and referrals from existing external partners.   Advancing University Economic Engagement  The  UofM  is committed to advancing economic development in the region and demonstrates its  leadership through participation on boards, curricular engagement with the community, providing  technical expertise, publishi ng research of best practices, and attending and hosting international,  national and regional conferences.  One means of contributing is by serving on committees, taskforces  and boards  of  regional, national and multinational corporations, non -profit or ganizations and  community groups.  Local governments and businesses are partnering with the Brookings Foundation in  
p2700
aVWashington, D.C. to create a regional metropolitan economic plan.  The President of the UofM is a  member of the planning processes\u2122 Steering  Committee.  Six  subcommittees  have been formed to  develop the components of the plan.  A faculty member of the UofM is serving as a member and   providing support research for each committee.  The Assistant to the President sits on the Greater  Memphis Chamb er of Commerce\u2122s Business Recruitment and Retention Committee.  Nationally,  UofM  administrators and faculty members provide leadership for a number of academic organizations   concerned with economic development such as the American Council on Education, , C ommission on  Human Resources and Social Change, Urban Serving Universities Coalition, Association for Public and  Land Grant Universities, and the Society for College and University Planning.  One mechanism for gauging the university\u2122s engagement is through  the Engaged Scholarship Survey and   a review of academic community engagement activities by faculty.  A recent review of courses indicated  that  faculty in all eleven colleges and schools taught almost 1,500 classes that engaged approximately  3,600 stud ents in community engagement activities.   Examples include neighborhood revitalization in  West Memphis, AR, South Memphis, TN, Memphis, TN, Henning, TN, and Covington, TN, where students  serve as consultants to the communities.   The  UofM  will continu e to provide technical expertise to the community as  it advance s economic  development throughout the region.  The university operates a state of the art communications network  with over 17,000 nodes  providing  connectivity across the main and regional campu ses and facilities, on -campus residences, the Internet, and high -performance national research networks (e.g. I2).  The  University of Memphis is the State of Tennessee Connector site for the  Internet2  research netwo rk, is a  founding member of the  Memphis Coalition for Advanced Networking  (MCAN), and provides  connectivity to researchers at  St. Jude Children's Research Hospital , the University  of Memphis, the  University of Tennessee Health Science Center ,  Memphis BioWorks Foundation  as well as to the  Oak  Ridge National Laborato ries . Members of the University community publish their research findings and best practices in academic  journals, as confirmed by results of the Engaged Scholarship Survey of faculty.  According to the survey,  approximately 40% of respondents indicated t hat their community collaborations led to peer -reviewed  publications.   Faculty  members  conduct research in the areas of community and neighborhood  redevelopment, affordable housing, retail trade potential, railroad opportunity analysis, population  studies,  employment and wage growth, fiscal issues, economic networks, emerging economies, capacity  building, etc.  Findings and best practices are published in academic journals and presented at   international, national, state and regional conferences focusing on  a wide array of disciplines.  As one  example, in 2012 , recently retired former p resident, Dr. Shirley C. Raines , presented the UofM\u2122s  experience in fostering high growth entrepreneurship to the President\u2122s National Advisory Council on   Innovation and Entrepr eneurship . Active participation in professional associations by attending and sponsoring conferences, workshops   and training is another manner in which  UofM  faculty and staff engage in learning and purveying best  practices with the broader community.  An  example of this activity from the FedEx Institute of  Technology is the conference on research and innovation that the Institute sponsors.  The conference

aVCase Studies  FedEx Institute  of Technology: Institutionalizing Interdisciplinary  Entrepreneurialism  Many corporations and universities engage in economic  development through partnerships to advance the d esign  and production of a particular company\u2122s or industry\u2122s  products.   This is a case, however, where the  entrepreneurial spirit of the company has been translated  into a framework for multidisciplinary economic   development work by its university partner.    The  company, FedEx Corporation,  began as an  entrepreneurial adventure into the air freight industry.   Guided by that spirit, FedEx  has moved from a company that just moves freight to one that now owns  the  logistical structure and  technology used to orde r, track, manage inventory, and deliver a major  portion of the world\u2122s goods.    That spirit of  entrepreneurism led to  the creation of the FedEx Institute of Technology (FIT) at  the  University of Memphis .  The FIT building was opened by the University of Me mphis  in 2003.   It has  110,000 square fee t with software research labs, technology transfer offices, and classrooms.  It is also  home of a state -of -the -art United Nations -type amphitheater, with language translation and technology  capabilities to host inte rnational meetings for business.   However, t he meaning of FIT was summed up  by then President, Dr. Shirley Raines when she said, \ufb01The physical space is impressive, but more  importantly, the FedEx Institute of Technology serves as a hub for innovation and e ntrepreneurship, the  place where business, education and innovation intersect.\ufb02  In the ten years since its opening, FIT has  more than lived up to those expectations.  In a short period of time FIT has become  an epicenter for interdisciplinary research  rela ted to the  economic development of the Memphis region .  In fiscal year 2012, FIT  researchers  generated $14  million in external research funding .  Centers and Institutes and examples of their products fostered by  FIT include:  Center for Smart Bio materials (established 2012)  a. Biomedical Engineering, Chemistry, Physics and Electrical Engineering  b.  Design strategies to invent new implantable infection -control materials that detect and  respond to specific strains of infectious organisms   c. Example: Device  that uses electrical stimulation and aerogel materials to guide the  reattachment of severed ends and damaged nerves.   Center for Translational Informatics (established 2011)

Example: developed Auto Tutor  Auto Tutor, a computer tutor   system t hat tracks the cognition  and emotions of students to help   them learn about physics, reading,   and computer literacy   Two FIT Centers have become critical resources in developing regional industrial research infrastructure  and capacity.  The  Systems Testing  Excellence Program (STEP)  established in 2006 is an interdisciplinary  initiative for testing all aspects of business systems including hardware testing, software testing,  requirements testing and testing of business rules.  Over 600 testers and developers  have gone through  STEP training programs.  The International Research Workshop on Advances and Innovations in Software  
p2704
aVTesting , held annually at FIT , is  attended by software testers from all over the world .  STEP has  continued to develop partnerships with in dustries and agencies including a partnership with the Joint  Interoperability Test Command of the U.S. Department of Defense.  The other center, the Center for  Information Assurance (CIA), is certified by the Committee on National Security Systems to provi de  information assurance research, training and career development for students and professionals in the  field.  Offering on -line training, more than 5,000 professionals have completed the program.  In addition,  CIA research has led to advances in intrusio n detection for complex networked computer systems.    Creating the setting for research and supporting infrastructure capacity, though necessary, are not  enough to produce and sustain economic development.  To do so requires support to translate those  asse ts into action.  FIT is also the source for that translation.  One support is for technology transfer.  FIT created the Office of Technology Transfer in 2008 to aid in   the transfer of technologies from the University to impact the region\u2122s economy.  Prior t o its opening,  the University had few patent applications and invention disclosures.  Since its five years of operation,  there have been 77 patent applications with 13 now approved, 90 inventions disclosures, and 10  revenue producing licenses.  Another supp ort is to provide space and resources to enable University faculty and students to become  entrepreneurs with their ideas.  To do so, FIT led the creation of the Crews Ventures Lab (CVL).  Opening  in Fall 2013, the CVL will provide flexible office space, fu rnished offices for visiting investors and  mentors, and lab areas for prototype development and advanced technological systems.    In sum, FIT, building on the entrepreneurial spirit of its founding corporate partner, the Federal Express  Corporation, has se rved as the catalyst for interdisciplinary partnerships on the University of Memphis  campus and with industries.  Centers and Institutes are producing discoveries in logistics, biomedical  engineering, technology and education matching the industrial cluste rs in the area.  Together they have  garnered over $30 million in external research funding to support that work.  Structures have been put  in place to move those discoveries to application and market.  FIT is a spark that has positioned the  University to s ustain its role as a contributor the region\u2122s economic development.

aVStrengthening Communities :  Putting Community Back in Economic  Development  Sustainable economic development goes beyond just advancing the performance of a particular industry  cluster in  a region.  It also requires building healthy economically viable communities.  Thus community  and neighborhood revitalization is an important tool in university economic development efforts.  A  challenge, though, is the relationship between community resi dents and a university in these efforts.  Often the university\u2122s faculty and students drive the selection and implementation of the project.  While  useful, many times such projects may not reflect resident priorities and are not sustained beyond the  period  of the project or grant.    Addressing these issues, the University of Memphis forged a unique community economic development  partnership with the Memphis Regional Community Foundation (MRCF) and United Way of the  MidSouth (UWMS).  To engage communities mo re effectively, the MRCF, UWMS and the University  formed a partnership changing the power relations in the grant process.  The URCF and UWMS annually  give the University a block grant of funds called \ufb01Strengthening Communities\ufb02 for community building  purpo ses. Students in the University\u2122s Graduate Program in Public and Nonprofit Administration  administer the grant program giving them practical experience in working with nonprofits.  Nonprofit  community groups develop proposals based on what they want done i n their communities.   Communities receiving the grants administer the grant\u2122s funds.  They select the faculty and students  that they wish to work with at the university.   http://www.memphi s.edu/scgrants/docs/2013_cb_rfp.pdf   The result is to put the direction of the  grant, control of the funds, and selection of the partner in the hands of the community altering what is   done, how it is done and how it is sustained.  In the 5 years since its  inception , 32 capacity -building and small grants have been awarded to improve  neighborhoods and spur economic growth. Thirty community -partner organizations have hosted funded  projects with 23 faculty/student research partners funded. Nearly $350,000 in t otal combined dollars  have been invested in community -based projects and research.  Two examples of the process and  outcomes of the Strengthening Communities initiative are the South Memphis project and the Memphis  Music Magnet.    In the first case, a nei ghborhood south of downtown Memphis called South Memphis has been one of  the most economically distressed and neglected communities in the  City.  Reverend Kenneth Robinson,  pastor of St. Andrew\u2122s AME Church in the area approached the University to be a pa rtner in  revitalization of the neighborhood.  A community development corporation founded by church, The  Works, formed a coalition including the church, a local architectural firm, the Memphis Regional Design  Center, and the University of Memphis to create  the South Memphis Renaissance Collaborative. (SMRC).   With support from Strengthening Communities and the Hyde Family Foundation, SMRC designed and  implemented a comprehensive set of community improvement projects to enhance the quality of life  for reside nts of South Memphis.  
p2706
aVOver 400 longtime neighborhood residents and more than 40 students and faculty members from the  University teamed to study population and housing trends, survey building conditions, and interview a  cross -section of area civic leaders  to gain an understanding of existing physical and social conditions of  the area.  Two -person teams composed of neighborhood residents and University students conducted a  door -to-door survey gathering ideas and suggestions from residents for improving the  quality of life  within their community.  The results of the studies were then reviewed by community residents leading  to the creation of the South Memphis Revitalization Action Plan (SoMeRAP).   http://www.nw.org/network/green/documents/SomeRapFactSheet.pdf . The plan laid out a set of  intermediate and long term projects ranging from immediate services to long term physical planning.  One action was approval of the plan by the Memp his City Council in March, 2010, committing the city to  the public sector components of the plan including the redesign of a major thoroughfare in the  community, receipt of a $250,000 implementation grant for a Children\u2122s Development Center and  Farmers Mar ket structure, and steps toward opening a primary care center for the neighborhood.   Another outcome grew from community complaints about the absence of any traditional food  supermarkets in the area making South Memphis a real \ufb01food desert.\ufb02  As a result,  a South Memphis  Farmers Market was created providing  access to locally produced healthy foods..   http://somefm.org/ .  Not only has the South Memphis   Farmers Market been a success, is  spawned the creation of a mobile  venu e called the Green Machine  Food Market.  This market in the  form of a transformed bus  provided by the Memphis Area  Transit authority now serves 15   locations in economically  distressed neighborhoods  throughout the city.   The South Memphis project was featu red in 2010 by the White House\u2122s Office of Faith -Based and  Neighborhood Partnerships.  One of the faculty members involved with the project, Dr. Katherine  Lambert -Pennington, received the 2011 Ernest Lynton Award for Early Career Scholars.  In another Me mphis neighborhood, a recording studio , S tax , in the  1960\u2122s once served as a hub of creativity for community economic  and social well -being.  Stars such as Isaac Hayes and Otis Redding  lived and worked in the area.  Stax went bankrupt in the 1970\u2122s and  an already  modest neighborhood declined, saddled with  disinvestme nt, flight and public housing.  With that history and circumstances as background, with support  from a Strengthening Communities grant, a neighborhood  association Soulsville USA teamed with students  and faculty members in the UofM\u2122s City and Regional  The Green Machine Mobile Food Market

aVPlanning program and other support groups to create the Memphis Music Magnet plan.  Building on the  creative assets and history of the area, the plan connects the music history and assets of the  neighbor hood with broader community development opportunities.  Vacant structures are being  repurposed to provide space and facilities in the neighborhood for artists to gather in creative activities.   Physical revitalization includes home ownership incentives and  creation of single family, music -focused  multi -family and mixed -use commercial development on a large concentration of vacant land and  properties currently held in the Shelby County Land Bank as a consequence of tax foreclosures.   Since  Memphis\u2122 business  and civic leaders recognize the music industry as critical to the city\u2122s future economic  success the Memphis Music Magnet plan is well on the way to the revitalization of Soulsville USA.

aVMemphis Research Consortium : The Urban Research Park of the Future Now  Since their inception post World War II, research parks have provided an important strategy for industry  and universities t o advance economic development in a region.  Core to the concept is co -locating a  critical mass of skilled researchers and facilities to be engaged as teams in research leading to  commercial applications in that area.  That sharing has become even more imp ortant given a growing  need for interdisciplinary approaches to inquiry and the need for efficiencies in increasingly complex and  expensive research equipment and technology.  In spite of their contributions, there are significant barriers to the creation  of new university based  research parks.  That is particularly the case for universities located in urban areas.  For one, the cost of  land makes the price of a park prohibitive.  For another, start -up costs in buildings and equipment put  new university bas ed research parks out of financial reach.  Technology, though, has made possible a  new form of Research Park, the virtual urban research park.  In the virtual urban research park, researchers are located within the facilities of existing universities   and c ompanies in a given city or region.  Funding is directed to create inter -institutional interdisciplinary  research teams.  Researchers already in place form teams.  Additional researchers and facilities needed  for project teams are added within the existing  institutions.  Technology connects them in projects while  location in the urban area gives researchers access for face -to-face contact, helpful in working through  new concepts and methods.  The result is a research park without the real estate and facilit ies cost of  creating a separate park.    That process drove the creation of the Memphis Research Consortium (MRC).  Health care, the  biomedical industry and logistics are core components of the Memphis regional economy which   combined directly account for ov er 64,000 jobs.  Memphis is the home of several institutions that have  been independently active in research in those areas.  Health care included some of the largest and  advanced hospital systems in the United States, St. Jude Children\u2122s Research Hospital , Methodist/Le  Bonheur Healthcare, and Baptist Memorial Health Care.  The biomedical industry includes the Memphis  Bioworks Foundation, Smith & Nephew, Wright Medical Technologies and Medtronic.  Federal Express  Corporation is a global leader in logistics.  Underlying all of these areas are two research universities, the  University of Memphis (UofM) and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC).  The   opportunity and challenge was how to build from those institutional strengths to further adva nce the  region in national and global markets.    Led by the University of Memphis President at the time, Dr. Shirley Raines, a memorandum of  understanding was developed in 2010 to collaborate in research and share facilities among the 10  institutions.  In  short, the proposal was to create the new urban virtual research park and was approved  by state with beginning funding support of $10 million.    With an initial appropriation of $500,000 in seed funding from State CTTA funds in FY10 -11 and $10  million in S tate of Tennessee INCITE funds allocated in FY11 -12, MRC partners have leveraged existing  assets and collaborations and forged new initiatives designed to enhance regional economic growth  
p2709
aVthrough research, workforce development, talent acquisition, and tar geted technology  commercialization activities in areas tied to the region\u2122s economic interests and national research  priorities.    \u201aGenomics and Population Health\u2122 and \u201aBiomaterials, Biologics, and Biomedical Devices (B3)\u2122 were  identified as areas of joint  interest and investment focus by MRC industry and university partners, in  consultation with the Tennessee Economic and Community Development Division and local elected   officials.  To date, nearly $3.6 million in MRC funds have been allocated for collabora tive research, talent  acquisition, workforce development, and technology commercialization activities in these targeted  areas. In addition, university and industry sources have contributed more than $2.5 million in cash  resources, as well as additional in -kind support, to these efforts.  Together, MRC partners have invested  State and their own resources in:   10 collaborative research projects , involving both academic and industry or community partners   3 new faculty hires   2 new laboratories to support Stem Ce ll Biology and Soft Tissue Engineering research   1 new  Process Validation/ Quality Assurance Lab  and  coursework, now serving 34 students   10 new technologies to support  proof of concept or marketing study funds   4 new industry internships for biomedical engine ering students   1 next generation genomic sequencing instrument   1 networking database   Thus far, these projects have directly or indirectly supported 88 jobs, including 26 new jobs. According  to the Sparks Bureau for Business and Economic Research, s pending  by the MRC of $2.2 million is  estimated to have directly and indirectly generated nearly $1.25 million in labor income, value added of   $1.9 million, and a total impact on the local economy of more than $4.3 million.  Because many of these  activities are on -going, they will continue to produce economic impact in future years. In addition, plans  are in place to allocate remaining MRC funds through completion of seven additional faculty hires in the   coming months and investments in additional academic -industry  collaborative research and workforce  development activities.  One example of MRC work is a focus on interventions to reduce or prevent obesity among pediatric  populations.   Because many behaviors and lifestyle habits that fuel  obesity begin early in life o r have a genetic basis , this  research is  focusing on genomic and genetic bases for pediatric disease and  preventative and behavioral interventions in pediatric obesity.  One  project, the Systems Dynamics Modeling of Childhood Obesity project, is  discoveri ng alternative models of effective balances between exercise  and caloric intake.  Another, FitKids,  is a web -based community -clinic  linked interactive tool for pediatric obesity screening and intervention.   Partnerships are now in place with child -oriented  community venues  (e.g., museums, libraries, entertainment and recreational venues, and   schools) to make FitKids widely accessible using interactive computers  and kiosks.

aVAnother example connects MRC to a major regional economic cluster, biomedical devic es.  Shelby  County, Tennessee has the nation\u2122s second largest concentration of biodevice  companies.   As a result,  MRC research  priorities include genetic, molecular, and surgical factors that impact outcomes in joint  replacement, reconstructive surgery, a nd remodeling with specific emphasis on research on the devices  themselves (optimization of materials and design), research on the role of soft tissue in repair and   reconstruction, and research on the response of the host bone/joint/soft tissue to the impl ant.    
p2711
aVGrowth/Improvement Plan  Internal Structure  This area focuses on changes in internal structures to enhance the responsiveness and effectiveness of  faculty involvement in economic development and on  changes in incentive systems to support that  involvement.  As a beginning point, Academic Affairs is going through management change that will  affect all three improvement areas.  Starting AY 2013 -14, Academic Affairs is adopting a Responsibility  Manageme nt Center (RMC) model where each unit will receive all of its revenues and income and be  responsible for its own expenses.  The incentive for economic development is that economic   development partnerships serve a unit by providing a source for revenue and  a means for recruiting and  retaining students.    Regarding responsiveness and effectiveness, the Provost is creating interdisciplinary centers around  policy and development issues such as entrepreneurialism, transportation, industry clusters, and  community  revitalization.  Centers will be developed based on externally generated needs and  opportunities providing responsiveness and flexibility.  Units and faculty members will be credited for  their contributions in the units\u2122 RMC plans.  To assist in team buil ding, a centralized online system will  be created containing contact information of all faculty members  collaborating with, or mentoring,  other faculty members on a topic or sponsored research.    One step in addressing incentive systems is to  develop clarity in the tenure and promotion process.  To  do so, each college will develop and begin implementation of a faculty workload policy in AY 2013 -14.   Engagement in economic development activities will be included in a college\u2122s or unit\u2122s workloa d as  appropriate to that discipline.  The workload policy will provide additional support by defining different  faculty responsibilities applicable to tenure and promotion such as teaching or engaging in economic  development activities.  A second issue rais ed in the assessment was the question of the level of indirect charges on sponsored  research and service.  Charging a Federal rate of 40% left faculty uncompetitive for many locally funded  opportunities.  Academic Affairs will be reviewing that policy in 2 013 and exploring possibilities for  different rates for centers involved in regional economic development activities.   Access  How do researchers know what one another is doing in regards to economic development?  How does   the community find out about the c apabilities of UofM researchers for economic development research  and outreach?  How does the community access the UofM\u2122s capabilities to do economic development  and outreach?  Each of these issues were raised by the internal and external focus groups.  At  the beginning of AY 2013 -14, Information Technology as a separate division in the UofM was  integrated into Academic Affairs.  The integration was done with the intent of improving through  
p2712
aVinformation technology the coordination of information across all un its within Academic Affairs and the  UofM.  One of the outcomes will be the creation in 2013 -14 a centralized online system for reporting  and for access to the range of research and outreach performed by faculty members including economic  development activi ties.  A searchable webpage will be created to enhance access.  Returning to the impact of the RMC model, each unit will be required to include a community  connection plan in its 2013 -2014 AY unit plan.  The plan will not only include the unit\u2122s outreach pl an for  community connection, it will outline its plans for external advisors including economic development  stakeholders.  Finally, at the initiative of the UofM\u2122s Interim President and Provost, that leadership team plus relevant  Deans and Center Directors  is scheduled to personally meet with the CEO\u2122s of the 25 -30 largest  employers in the region by the end of December, 2013.  The purposes are straightforward, what are   your human resources and economic development needs over the next 10 years?  What can the  UofM   do to meet those needs?  The meetings will provide a means of informing those leaders of the resources  of the UofM to assist their development.  And it will provide the forum for setting up the access points  to the UofM for those businesses and access  points for the UofM to those businesses and agencies.   Workforce  The external assessment made very clear the desire by external stakeholders for the UofM to link its  curriculum more closely to the knowledge and skills needed by regional industries and bus inesses.   Likewise, internal participants in the assessment expressed their interest in improving those  connections.  Several practices are in place to respond to that need.  One, as mentioned in Area Improvement Plan 2,  each unit will be required to includ e a community connection plan in its 2013 -14 and beyond RMC unit  plans.  Those plans must explicitly address the contributions of the unit\u2122s contributions to community   including economic development.  Two, as also mentioned in Area Improvement Plan 2, UofM  leadership will be meeting with the CEO\u2122s of the 30 largest employers in the region by December, 2013.   The questions they will ask are the human resources and economic development needs of those  employers and how the UofM can play a role in addressing th ose needs.  Appropriate Deans and  Directors will participate in those meetings providing guidance for curriculum needs within their  Colleges and units.  That practice will be repeated in subsequent months and years as the team and  academic leaders will mee t with small businesses, start -ups, and entrepreneurs to assess their needs.  Finally, the UofM is undergoing a review in 2013 -14 of all of its advisory boards and memberships.  The  purpose is to ensure that there is systematic input by external stakeholder s into the activities of the  units including curriculum and regional economic development.  Changes in the boards will be made   where gaps are identified or membership is not effective or strategic.

Through business engagement, technology tra nsfer, industry partnerships, student  internships, entrepreneurship ,   and community assistance, the  U niversity  is  strengthen ing   its role in   .   Over the   past decade ,   the University has   produced  innovations  with  the w orld beyond academia and  inculcat ed   the entrepreneurial spirit within  its  research and teaching.   It  has incorporated collaboration  with external stakeholders into its vision for advancing knowledge  across  disciplines.  Achieving this  vision in a large, co mplex  institution like  U M   requires that assessment, planning, implementation, and  evaluation activities occur at different points in time across  an  array of units.  Rather than  comprehensive, top - down planning  with   directives initiated simultaneously, the  scope of economic  engagement at Michigan dictates coordination and collaboration between units and the administrati on ,  with engagement processes proceeding at varying rates across campus.  Innovation and  entrepreneurship are stochastic  as  are institutional   advances and planning  at  the scale and scope of  a university with a research budget of $1.3 billion.    A   look at the past decade creates a framework for understanding an especially dynamic period  for    economic   engagement and community development effor ts.  Administrative commitment was provided  by  President Mary Sue Coleman, who will step down after  serving two terms .  From the beginning of her  tenure in 2003,  she  placed an emphasis on how the University would collaborate across sectors,  institutions, and disciplines to make economic engagement part of  its  mission.   1    Her state and national  involvement on these issues has  characterized   her entire tenure.  She was di rectly involved in the 2004  Michigan Governor's Commission on Higher Education and Economic Development, and has since  presided over several major initiatives to advance the University's leadership in this realm.   2    She is  widely quoted for saying,  it is n o longer publish or perish, but partner or perish,  and the University  Regents recently recognized how much the institution has achieved under her  direction . 3     A WARD  P ROCESS  E XPERIENCE   Underpinning   UM's economic impact is the breadth and depth of the  U niver  ,  which saw r esearch expenditures of $1.27 billion in fiscal year 2012 .

Ten years  ago , i n 2002, the Office of Technology  Transfer gauged   its performance against other  universities.  This  benchmarking  effort led to the formation of the National Advisory Board  for  Technology Transfer  (NABTT), which   helped provide a strategic direction for technology transfer activity.  The original board members  came   from across the United States, with backgrounds in entrepreneurship,  venture capital, industry ,   and government.  The NABTT has provided the foundation fo r numerous  initiatives, including the creation of Ann Arbor SPARK  the regional economic development agency  and the UM Venture Center  a  virtual and physical space for company formation. 4

aVIn   2006, r esponding to slowing increases in federal research funding   and the economic transition in the  Great Lakes economies away from traditional industries,  the Office of Research began a transformative  planning process called  Advancing Innovation: Enhancing UM Industrial Relationships, Industry Research,  and Technology   Transfer  under the leadership of Vice President Stephen Forrest.  Faculty and    The ensuing report called for broadening the  orientation of the institution  towards industry and make it more outward looking   innovation and collaboration."  Recommendations centered on three broad goals: increase  understanding of industry goals by the Univ ersity community, encourage a culture of innovation within  the University, and coordinate and enhance partnerships with industry. 5    C ommittee proposals  aimed  to  encourage faculty to engage in entrepreneurial activities and form new companies, and to revise   research policies to make industry - sponsored projects more appealing and efficient for faculty.   E CONOMIC  E NGAGEMENT  E NTERPRISE   By implementing ideas from  Advancing Innovation ,  the University  embraced a n   institution - wide  commitment t o increasing opportunit ies  for  promoting  entrepreneurship , engaging   industry , and  connecting   with the community .

aV3     institutions  in the University Research Corridor, and all 15 public institutions in Michigan form the  Michigan Initiative for Innovation and Entrepreneurship to  facilitate  gap funding.  The University  collabo rates with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation to  support  new ventures  through  several programs, including as a co - sponsor of Accelerate Michigan  an  international business plan  competition.  The University also supports  Ann Arbor SPARK, the local  business incubator.  Established  business and communities in distress receive assistance from the Institute for Research on Labor,  Employment, and the Economy (IRLEE). 10     Entrepreneurship education uses a tradition of action - based, interdisciplinary learning to train students  to be innovative business leaders.   UM has several academic degrees and certifications in  entrepreneurship and is creating another.  There are entrepre neurship centers and training on campus in  the business, engineering, law, and medical schools .   Events like Entrepalooza and MPowered give  students opportunities to pitch ideas to investors, while the Center for Venture Capital and Private  Equity Finance  connects investors to the entrepreneurship community. 11   E CONOMIC  E NGAGEMENT  P LANNING   Effective service for grants and contracts is crucial to meeting the commitment to innovation. Over  2011, the Office of Research reviewed its unit that processes research g rants and contracts. The  University had set its sights on research expenditures of $2 billion by 2017   billion in expenditures. Internal processes would need to be revamped to meet the workload. The  review aimed to create a more resp onsive customer service unit for the University by making the  organizational structure, its processes, technology, and workforce more aligned with anticipated  needs  accompanied by performance metrics.  The reorganized unit, now called the Office of Researc h  and Sponsored Programs (ORSP),   developed a more rapid approach to industry agreements  called  the  Michigan Research Advantage  that provides a menu of up - front contract terms, including IP royalty  rates. ORSP has also established a new joint clinical trial s office with the Medical Campus to streamline  agreements within mutually determined time limits.     The University has been involved in the recent development and refinement of the CICEP Assessment  Tools, including pilot tests of both instruments.  In the  s ummer   of 2011, the External Tool was tested  with stakeholders that interact with the Office of Technology Transfer, the Business Engagement Center   (BEC) , and the Office of Community Relations.  Results were shared with the BEC   Advisory Council ,  which promp ted a dialogue that has resulted in a new  operations  model .    Whereas BEC 1.0 was created  to be the front door for industry and was focused on establishing and managing relationships, BEC 2.0 is  the evolution of the Center to advance these  corporate relatio nships   by becoming more strategic in  evaluating and maintaining them .     The Internal Tool was  administered   in the spring of 2013   and is generating new ideas for integrating  activities between programs. For example,  through   work with small businesses identified by the BEC,  IRLEE is incorporating new technologies disclosed to the OTT .   IRLEE is undergoing a five - year review  examining how well its current activities fulfill its original mission and whether its programs are eff ective

P ROMOTION AND  C OMMUNICATION   A highly effective aspect of the Univer sity     commitment to incorporating the economic  engagement  message in her communication to key  constituencies, which include the University community, the Regents, state and federal officials and  legislators, a lumni, as well as the media. Other UM executives, most notably the Vice President for  Research, also  speak   on this issue.   The UM has identified goals and tactics for communicating about economic development. A focused  strategy for economic development comm unications is devised and coordinated by a core team  consisting of representatives from the central offices of research, communications, government  relations, technology transfer, and business engagement as well as from the College of Engineering and  the R oss School of Business.    The team oversees a central website,  www.innovate.umich.edu   that   captures the full range of programs  and activities that are related to economic development,  discussed above as the enga gement  enterprise .  The team also collaborates on identifying and disseminating economic development news   Innovate!: Great Ideas Change  Everything,  is  a publication  distributed annually  that  provid es an overview of activities and drives traffic  to  the   website.   Key messages are targeted  to stakeholders and delivered  via   new and traditional media channels . (See  the lists below.)   UM is actively building a community of interest surrounding its economic  development  mission, and recently conducted a national survey about entrepreneurship directed at the alumni of     The core team has established ties with several economic development organizations in the state to  coordi nate on messages, activities, and events.

A DVANCING  U NIVERSITY  E CONOMIC  E NGAGEMENT   The University of Michigan has taken on a leading national   and  global role in economic development. In  2010, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke  named President Coleman co - chair of the National Advisory  Council on Innovation and Entrepreneurship   (NACIE) , which  produced   the  University  Presidents/Chancellors Commitment Letter on Commercialization of University Research   to President  Obama stressing po licy recommendations for increasing the transfer of technology from academi a   to  the marketplace.   S he was selected by President Obama as one of six university presidents to help  launch the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership, a national effort bringing toge ther industry,  universities ,   and the federal government.  She  is the immediate past chair of the Association of American  Universities   and  serves with the presidents of Michigan State University and Wayne State University as  leadership for the University Res earch Corridor.

S everal programs started at the University became the models for state - wide expansion. The  BEC  was  the model f or the  Michigan Corporate Relations Network   (MC RN),  connecting six Michigan universities  with industry.   OTT  served as the model for a state initiative with six other Michigan public universities to  accelerate technology commercialization by connecting entr epreneurs and experts to ideas and  intellectual property ,  called the  Tech Transfer Talent Network .   To   fast - track more research from the lab to the  outside   world, UM is now a node of the National Science  Foundation's (NSF) Innovation Corps program, designed to train scientists and engineers how to ex pand   their  view   beyond basic research and toward practical applications.

CASE STUDIES   Case Study #1: IRLEE   The  Institute for Research on Labor, Employment, and the Economy   (IRLEE) ex tend s the reach of the  University  through   leading business and regional development in   service of   the broader economy.  IRLEE  was established in July 2008   by   merging two long - standing university units: the Institute of Labor and  Industrial Relations (ILIR) and   the Business and Industrial Assistance Division (BIAD ) .  This  enable d   the  University to   direct   its economic   outreach activities in areas where  it   has demonstrated academic and  programmatic strengths.  Currently, IRLEE is comprised of eight centers and programs with services  falling into three broad areas: business assistance, economic development   interventions for  communities experiencing economic  transition , and ec onomic impact and forecasting.    The Institute provides research, consulting, and technical assistance in partnership with multiple  sponsors.  Although housed at the University of Michigan, IRLEE serves the entire  s tate of Michigan, the  M i dwest , and the United States.  Many programs are funded through the Economic Development  Administration (EDA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce, although other initiatives are frequently  sponsored by the Departments of Labor, Agriculture, and Defense.   IR LEE also works with e conomic  development organizations in Michigan and other states.   From   2008 - 2012, the Institute secured more  than $27 million in external grants and contracts.   Although IRLEE has many initiatives serving different  constituencies, the  t hree  programs discussed  below   exemplify  how  IRLEE serves the Midwest, and how  communities can be helped with different needs over time.     Manufacturers in Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana adversely impacted by foreign  trade   have been receiving  direct business a ssistance from the University of Michigan  since 1983 .  The   Great Lakes Trade  Adjustment Assistance Center   (GLTAAC)   administers the  Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms   (TAAF ) ,  which   is the only federal program specifically designed  for  companies negatively affected by foreign  competition.  It  helps eligible companies assess their current business situation, develop a realistic  strategy and actionable recovery   plan,  and  then pa ys   half  the cost of hiring  external  consultants to  implement  the plan. To date, GLTAAC has assisted over 300 firms , and has a 95% survival rate in the past  5 years .  T he GLTAAC  web site   provides other  metrics   of higher   sales, hiring, and profitability, and  individual  success stor i es . 12

aVare : to provide   technical assistance to businesses in distress, and  to  intervene   in communities experiencing economic transition .  These elements were combined  through  two   programs designed to assist communities experiencing layoffs in the manufacturing sector.   The  EDA Community Economic Adjustment Program 13   (CEAP)  ran from  2006 - 2011 .    Partnering with  the   Center for Automotive Research 14   (CAR), CEAP helped to reduce the socioeconomic hardship  experienced  by  communities in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin  from  plant  clos ures and restructuring  among  automotive and manufacturing industries. CEAP administered a n   "early - warning system"  combining  industry and economic data  with  media reports to identify plants at  risk of closure or workforce reduction.  CEAP organized  focus gr oups so  affected communities  could  determine their needs and  receive  training  connect ing   them with support services and/or funding

aV8     opportunities through federal, state, and non - profit resources.   O rganizations  proposing solutions  received  assistance in pre paration of grant narratives and the review of applications. This  successful   program  concluded when  the cycle of major plant closing ended.  In total, CEAP conducted 36 focus  groups, operated 42   grant workshops, and ultimately provided assistance  for   106 grant proposals. 15
p2733
aVFrom 2008 -  Growth (MDLEG) for the Michigan Business: Surviving to Thriving program (S2T).  S2T grew out of a pilot  program called the Advanced Manufacturing Assistance Pr ogram (AMAP), which was created to help  struggling  manufacturers in the automotive supply chain.  MDLEG sought a program that would assist  all   -  S2T operated in three phases.  The  process   began with an application and financial disclosure phase.  Selected firms proceeded through a  planning phase taking several weeks, which involved detailed financi al analysis, interviews with  managers and employees, and observations of operational processes.  Planning culminated in  recommendations for action, identification of projects, and definitions for scopes of work.  The  implementation phase consisted of S2T p rojects managers identifying outside professionals to consult  with the firms, with the program   paying for half  of the cost, up to $25,000.  In total, 205 firms were  helped through S2T,  which had a  98%  survival rate.   Over 1,00 0   jobs were retained at a time   when the  sector lost 26% of its employment.     These three programs represent a convergence of engagement in that they served many of the same  communities and industries  for different needs  at different points in time.  The y   demonstrate how a  sustained com mitment to  engagement  makes the University a known partner for economic  development, which can lead to opportunities to develop new initiatives .   Figure  1   below  is a  map of  Michigan showing the convergence of these programs   and how the engagement initiatives in one  capacity overlap with additional relationships .  Michigan counties that  were involved in a CEAP  workshop are shaded yellow.  GLTAAC clients are indicated by   the blue triangles,  and S2T   clients are  indicated by the pink circles   (the stars are for a separate program) .  The distribution of clients  demonstrates that  having credibility  in those communities through GLTAAC gave IRLEE  a platform to  succeed  with CEAP  and S2T.   Forty - one clients used both GLTAAC and S2T, and many counties had both  CEAP and S2T clients.     T hese programs work directly with the people affected, building relationships and basing decisions on  data and local knowledge.    S ince  they  use similar, data - driven warning systems to identify clients, and  use the expertise of IRLEE staff to identify turnaround strategies, the process shows how proven models  can be replicated and used in conjunction to achieve  heightened success.   IRLEE contin ues to grow by  applying the lessons learned from  these  programs to  develop  new initiatives  with  strategies that are  more refined .   The Institute  is  now  in the midst of a five - year review and, having just  emerged from a  period of both success and transition   into new programs,   looks to continue fulfilling its mission  to serve  the University and the  regional  economy.

aV10     Case Study #2: Business Engagement Center   The Advancing  Innovation report called for the creation of a center that would serve as a single, visible  point of entry for industry. In 2007, the provost and the vice presidents for research, development, and  government relations collaborated with schools and colleges   to establish the  Business Engagement  Center   (BEC) .  The BEC    relationships from one physical location, the  University leverage s   its efforts to raise awareness among potential partners, provide s   a simpler means  of access to campus research and faculty expertise, and work s   more efficiently with regional and state  econ omic   development efforts.  In partnership with corporate   relations colleagues in the College of  Engineering, the Medical School, the Ross School of Business, the collective group works to create and  expand partnerships with industry by linking business need s with University resources in research,  technology, education ,   and student talent on the Ann Arbor, Flint and Dearborn campuses.

These three offices are co - located at the North Campus  Research Complex, providing rich opportunities for collaborative corporate engage ment.
p2736
aV A Matrix of Connections   Creating an operational framework that effectively matches corporate needs with available resources  has been the lynchpin to the  BEC's   success.  The model functions as follows : (see  Figure  2 ).   The BEC assigns a triad of liaison responsibilities to each of its relationship managers. These include:    1)   A unique portfolio of companies. No company is duplicated among the team members, so there  is a clear single point of contact from the university.   2)    organizations ,   chambers of commerce ,   and other university partners across the state.    3)   A set of internal university units. Each relationship manager is responsible for six to eight units,   er staff about key  engagement opportunities within those units.
p2737
aV     In addition to managing its portfolio of current corporate partners, the BEC receives over 200 new  company inquiries annually, the majority of which come from smaller, regionally based businesses. To  meet that challenge the BEC has created a robust resource network  often  blending resources from  beyond the borders of its own institut ion  in  order to facil itate connections to the right partner.   This  framework has allowed the BEC to successfully manage a portfolio of more than 400 managed corporate  partnerships, while also providing bandwidth to support upwards of 1 ,2 00 company inquiries since its  inception.  The Center  has also established relationships with 30 community organizations and liaison  assignments with 42 University units.
p2738
aV12     Driving Local Economic Development   In 2011, the BEC enhanced its engagement networ k in a significant way with the launch of the  Michigan  Corporate Relations Network   (MCRN). Launched through  a $1.8M grant from the Michigan Economic  Development Corporation and the Michigan Strategic Fund, MCRN i  university business engagement network. Partner institutions include the University of Michigan, which  serves as the project lead, Michigan State University, Michigan Technological University, University of  Michigan - Dearborn,   Wayne State University, and Western Michigan University.    In addition to establishing or enhancing corporate relations offices on all six campuses, MCRN has  developed three distinct outreach programs  targeted at small and midsize businesses in Michigan  to   spur innovation and retain talent. Many of the programs were first piloted through the BEC. The  Small  Company Innovation Program   (SCIP) offers matching funds for company specif ic research projects with  MCRN partner universities.    Embed video here:    http://www.youtube.com/embed/BrQHI - 3403k?rel=0     The  Small Company Internship Award Program   (SCIA) provides matching funds for students to work as  summer interns or in cooperative positions with corporate partners in the STEM (science, t echnology,  engineering and mathematics) fields. And the  Instant Innovation Program   (IIP) pairs Michigan companies  with faculty experts from MCRN universities for day - lon g brainstorming sessions focused on technology,  new innovations, and business issues. Other MCRN resources include a web - based experts and facilities  portal, which catalogues faculty expertise in a searchable database, and access to university libraries,  l abs and facilities.    In 2012 alone,  MCRN   and its programs awarded more than $170,000 in matching research grants to  companies and created 38 new internships with small companies across the state of Michigan.   Within  several companies, interns hired through the SCIA Program have turned into full - time positions .   National Model   The  BEC  has  bec o me a national model adopted by other universities .  The Center has hosted visiting  parties  from  the  University of Mississippi, Notre Dame, Northwestern, Indiana, Arizona State University ,  and  Shanghai Jiao To ng University   in China.  Other visits are occurring monthly.

aV13     Case Study #3:  The  Venture  Center   The UM  Office of Technology Transfer   (OTT) is the University unit responsible for transferring research  discoveries to business and venture partners.  Each year, it launches an average of 10 startups and signs  over 100 agreements with companies. These activities have led to the launch of ove r 115 ne w start - up  ventures since 2001.  These results reflect n ot only the dedication of the U M Tech Tr ansfer staff  which  numbers approximately 25  but  also the support of university administration,  which   two decades ago  incorporated   technology transfer and   economic development  into   the vision   of the university.   To create a central hub  for  startup ventures , OTT   created the  Venture Center   (VC)  in 2002  as a  central  point of acc ess for  entrepreneurs and venture funding partners  seeking to create new start - up ventures  based on technology developed by University researchers.   VC   staff have all the tools necessary to create  fundable teams, leverage existing programs, and ultimately l aunch companies with high growth  potential.   The VC has  a core staff of experienced  venture creation specialists   and  integrates the many  support  services   into four areas: business development, talent, funding, and other resources   (see  Figure  3   below ) .     Business development    The  VC  Business Formation Group   examine s   new business opportunities  using a three - s t age  evaluation  process.  The Assessment stage considers startup   feasibility and the commitments required of the  inventor.  The Business Planning stage seeks to fully define the product/service by examining the  business model, markets and customers, intellectual property protection, and the  technology  status .   The  Business Formation stag e includes writing the business plan, forming a startup team, and  connecting with funding sources.

aVTechStart   internship program has helped dozens of UM business development  projects move forward with the assi stance of  interdisciplinary teams of  entrepreneurial graduate  students. The program accepts as many as a dozen interns annually, all of whom work full - time from  May through July. Working in small teams, each student works on two or more projects simultaneo usly.  Every project presents unique challenges, but teams generally conduct competitive analysis, interview  industry insiders, identify market needs, and ultimately make recommendations regarding launch  strategy.    This program, in partnership with the Zell - Lurie Institute and the Center for Entrepreneurship,  provides a great educational experience, valuable business development resources for our projects, and  an increased opportunity for regional employment for our students after graduation.   Talent   The  Ment ors - in - Residence   (MiR) program seeks to leverage local entrepreneurial talent for the benefit  of UM startups by having   opportunity assessment and venture development services.  Prese ntly, OTT employs six Mentors - in - Residence. With decades of  industry  experience, these individuals help guide University  ventures  toward  successful launch by  assisting   with business modeling, customer needs assessment , and  connections to  customer prospects   and venture partners.  M iR  appointments can run as long as 18 months, with each  MiR working approximately 20 hours per week.

aV14     The  Catalyst Resource Network   is a worldwide network /database   of talented people that have made  commitments to either paid   or unpaid opportunities to assist  University  technology project s .  There are  five roles for talented advisors.  Industry experts offer unpaid assistance to ventures for short periods of  time, such as discussions or inquiries.  Mentors are i ndustry or tech nology leaders willing to volunteer  s everal hours a month to coach U M inventors ,   entrepreneurs, and students.     Consultants become paid  contractors on due diligence issues for which a venture lacks sufficient internal resources.  Potential  managers are  can didates for long - term leadership commitments to a company.  Finally, qualified  students can be volunteers or paid interns for a firm, under supervision from VC staff.     Funding   The VC can  help startups   apply for the  Michiga n Initiative for Innovation and Entrepreneurship , a  competitive gap funding program  at the state level  to address market valid ation issues, such as  prototype/ concept testing and market analysis. Funds awarded range from $5K to $100K.   The VC has  also  created a network of over 200 regional and national venture capital and angel partners.   Michigan Invests in New Technology Start - ups (MINTS) ,  created in  2011, positions the University as co - investor  with qualified venture firms  in promising UM start - ups. A n analysis by the UM Investment  Office of the returns from startups launched by OTT led to this initiative. The MINTS program can invest  up to $1 million alongside a lead venture capital firm in early - stage ventures launched from OTT.  The  program could inj ect up to $15 million during the next decade into such ventures.   Resources   The  Venture Accelerator   was launched in January 2011 and  enables University faculty to start their own  companies while accessing expert help to become successful.   It  provides late - stage UM  ventures  with  world - class laboratory and office space adjacent to the talent and business services of the Venture  Center in our North Campus Research Complex. It has filled up rapidly, and  is presently home to 18  companies.   Success   As whole, the  Venture Center has produced a steady - stream of high potential startup opportunities for  entrepreneurs and our venture capital partners. Over the last 10 years, the Center has launched 98 new  startups   ( one every five weeks )   providing job opportunities and e conomic advantages for the region.  Here and across the globe, more UM technologies were licensed to companies in 2012 than ever before.   In FY 2012, OTT worked with university researchers on 368 new technologies, executed 123  option/license agreements with   industry, and submitted 145 patent applications.  The  368 new  inventions reported by researchers in fiscal year 2012 was another record high, demonstrating the  broadened participation of UM faculty in tech transfer activities.  The University also  reported that 101  U.S patents were issued in fiscal year 2012, and $13.4 million in lic ensing royalties were received  providing  funds to reinvest in research and innovation.  Eleven new startup ventures  eight  of which are  headquartered in Michigan  were  lau nched in fiscal year 2012 with the guidance and resources of the  OTT Venture Center.

aV16     C.   GROWTH & IMPROVEMENT   PLAN   The areas for improvement detailed below are the product of the continual   assessment of engagement   activities , relationships with stakeholders, and University priorities discussed above in the process  narrative.    Owing to evolving needs , change   and growth continues in all areas that affect economic  development , even through tr ansitions in  University leadership .   Change plans and processes are  presented below for  business engagement,  entrepreneurial education , and  economic development  services   ( see  Table 1   below ) .    BEC 2.0   The Business Engagement Center (BEC) is the recognized leading model for universities to construct a  living portal   for connecting University resources with external partners. It serves many existing and  potential external partners as well as having a reach   into the university to help UM subunits be more  effective in making connections.  The BEC reports jointly to the Office of Research and the Office of  Development, and has an Advisory Board composed of senior leaders from the major units on campus.   Over th e past year, the BEC has engaged in a process to improve the model based on a variety of  assessments and analyses.  The goal is to become more strategic and focused on key companies , using  specific metrics ,   to deliver increased research contracts and philan thropic dollars.     While the APLU External Assessment Tool was used, the best source of feedback has been the careful  analysis of the usage of the BEC, looking at the range and number of relationships formed, metrics  associated with industry research, tech nology licensing, partnerships on Federal programs, student  placement, and corporate participation in advisory boards. The BEC also had extensive conversations  with its highly engaged corporate partners about what they value, where there are gaps in what U M  provides, and how they characterize high value relationships. Parallel conversations were conducted  with stakeholders on campus, including Deans, Directors of Corporate Relations, and faculty with  extensive industry experience. Additional analysis was co nducted to benchmark activity at other  universities.   The BEC staff undertook strategic planning that involved extensive analysis of all data and information,  several staff retreats, and testing of ideas with stakeholders on and off campus. The result is  BE C 2.0,  a  plan that acknowledges that the BEC has to be more focused in its interactions with stakeholders if it  intends to demonstrate value, both within and outside the university. BEC 2.0 focuses on those  relationships that either provide higher returns,   or look like they have potential to do so.  This plan was  reviewed and endorsed by senior university leadership as well as the BEC.    Prior to the implementation of BEC 2.0, the unit was managing relationships with over 1,200 companies.   These organization s were tiered into three categories by subjective data gathered from relationship  managers.   The launch of BEC 2.0 ushered in a more analytical approach to ensure that staff members  were managing their time and resources in the most productive manner by dev eloping a predictive   10 -

aV17     managed organizations were assign   for each organization (more positive outcomes such as higher le vels of historical phi lanthropy,  collaborative research,  and student recruitment  resulted in higher scores). These two scores were then  regressed against one another to create a predictive level of engagement.    The BEC now uses the model to strategically guide its activity    not   only to look at top performers, but  also to determine high - potential, low - performing prospects.   Additional metrics for evaluation  include  levels of prospect engagement, as well as corporate engagements to support scholarships and  internships for students,   collaborative research projects, and programmatic support for units.

aV Campus - wide Entrepreneurial Education   The  University of  Michigan    long - standing commitment   to entrepreneurship education has been rooted  in the traditional  disciplines    first  busines s and , as the entrepreneurial movement has grown,   engineering.  Recently,  UM students bega n demanding a campus - wide approach   and the University has  responded with a plan for the next five years .   P rograms  that  have anchored entrepreneurship education   at UM   will  help to develop  an   inclusive vision  for the future.  The  Zell - Lurie Institute   (ZLI)   in the Ross School of Business  has  provided   an array of  curricular and co - curricular opportunities , including  a viable entrepreneurial network and engage ment  of   the bus iness community .  The    Center for Entrepreneurship (CFE)   has  establish ed   a nine -  University. The CFE has  also  developed close relationships with co - curr icular group s, including  nearly 20  entrepreneurship - focused  UM  student organizations.  Further, there are joint   ZLI/CFE programs, such as  TechArb, a student startup accelerator .   Student interest in entrepreneurship programs has become increasingly robust: I n AY 2011/12, over  2200 students enrolled in  the  29 courses pre - approved for the Program in Entrepreneurship   [PIE]. PIE  had 319 active students. Eight clubs and 18 activities provided opportunities for funding, mentoring,  and  collaboration. A small living - learning community located in a UM residence hall brought together  interested students.    In May 2012 ,  University leadership convened a Campus - Wide Entrepreneurship Education (CWEE) task  force with the goal of developing a high - level design for campus - wide  entrepreneurship education for  undergraduates over the next five years.   T hroughout the summer and fall semesters,  the task force  compil ed   lists of courses and faculty, survey ed   student s ,  interviewed faculty , and benchmark ed  other  programs.    In a November 2 012 report, the Task Force outlined  a novel structure that leverages     broad cross - disciplinary   excellence.  The multi - part program offers UM students a clearly - defined, skills - based, critically - reflective, knowledge - based entrepreneurship education.

aV19     Aligning  IRLEE   with State Priorities   As part of its transition into new programs, the Institute for Research on Labor, Employment, and the  Economy (IRLEE) has been strengthening its ties with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation  (ME DC).  The expanding relationship with MEDC is reflected not only in new programs, but also in the  ongoing consultations that take place between IRLEE management and MEDC officials.  IRLEE program  directors meet regularly with key MEDC management to discuss   ways of expanding the role of   in MEDC visits to business incubators around the state, provides policy consultations, and comments on  possible new progra ms. Thus, many economic engagement goals for the Institute are aligned with the  priorities of the MEDC.    Revitalize Manufacturing Facilities :  T he National Excess Manufacturing Capacity Catalog (NEXCAP)  addresses  the  hundreds of millions of square feet of n onproductive commercial   and industrial space   stemming from the  decline  of the  manufacturing  sector .   NEXCAP is cataloging these v acant facilities  and  their surrounding communities  to create   a web portal ,  enabling  companies seeking manufacturing  space  to sea rch these   s   in  Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana. The EDA is working with IRLEE to scale up the portal  nationally.     Assist Communities Facing Defense Cuts : IRLEE is negotiating  with the Department of Defense to begin  a community assistance program to help areas experiencing layoffs from defense downsizing and  sequestration.  This proposal is a partnership with Purdue and Ohio State Universities, and is slated to  begin in November   2013.  The program will intervene  with defense contractors  to diversify  their  operations  into other defens e and non - defense technologies, and to develop action plans for  communities based on their strengths.     Facilitate Technology Transfer :  IRLEE introdu ced  the  Technology and Commercialization Assistance  (TCA)   program  in 2013  to facilitate technology  transfer to existing   SMEs .  TCA identifies the ir   capabilities ,   matches them with technologies in Michigan universities ,  and then   identifies supporting resourc es to  transfer technologies into commercial application. To date, TCA has screened 323 compa nies, assessed  30, and provided   technology searches for 15, with eight companies engaging in co - funded industry - university projects.   This has retained  125 jobs , wi th  four  others  created  within  these engagements.     Promote Startup Growth :  Th e First Customer Program (FCP) is designed for startup companies but can  also be accessed by established firms seeking to diversify.  FCP is focused on startup tech nology   companie s that need preparation for and introduction s   to  potential  customers.    FCP: 1)  assesses   a     for  value; 2) provides a market assessment; 3) identifies resources required for  closing the  deal with potential first customers; and 4) provides   access to  and coaching for  identified  resources.   Although the First Customer Program was just launched in Spring 2013, it is  already  h aving   an  impact .  FCP  has  worked with 22 Michigan companies (all manufacturing),  and t he quick start has  generated additi onal interest and support   at the state level . 16   Encourage Entrepreneurship :   The Center for Business Acceleration and Incubation Studies (CBAIS)  conducts market feasibility studies for communities considering establishing a new business incubator.  
p2751
aV20     In  addition, it has performed national assessments of incubator performance for the EDA.  CBAIS is  currently completing a feasibility study for manufactures and entrepreneurs in the Cadillac region, and is  in consultation with organizations in West Michigan t o conduct a new cluster analysis and feasibility  study for the life sciences sector.  CBAIS also consults with MEDC to ensure that three recently  established incubators can achieve sustainability , so their success will be an important measure .     Barriers :    Maintaining adequate grant and contract funding to support all of these programs long - term   Resources Needed : IRLEE is exploring alternatives for restructuring aspects of its operations model to  achieve closer integration with academic units such as Engineering, and to bring more faculty into the  Institute.   Elements of funding not dependent on the cycles of gra nt funding would help stabilize such  activities.

aV C ONCLUSION :   UM   E CONOMIC  E NGAGEMENT   The University   of Michigan   remains committed to stimulating economic development through the  integration of research, innovation, education, and entrepreneurship via co llaborations with industry,  government, and communities. As a national and global leader,  UM   has an opportunity to interact with  diverse constituents, and it will tap the expertise of its collaborators, external advisors, and stakeholders  when undertaking  improvement initiatives.     Over the last decade, as University faculty and staff have come to view having economic impact as not  just a byproduct of its activities, but as a valued purpose in itself, and as University leadership has  delivered a coherent eco nomic impact message, the citizens of the Michigan, its business leaders, and  state and community officials have become its active partners and beneficiaries.

aVUniversity of Minnesota  APLU\u2122s Innovation and Economic Prosperity Award Submission  Process Narrative    I. Introduction.   The University of Minnesota  (UMN) , the only  public  research institution  in the state, has  five  campuses  that  are located across the corners of  a predominantly rural  state . Its  largest campus  is situated  in a vibrant metropolitan area  (Twin C ities). In this regard, t he University  has in play both a robust  Urba n Agenda  that  links  its learning, research, and  outreach  initiatives  to critical  urban  issues, and a broad -based  set of initiatives focused on address ing  the needs of rural areas.   Given these  dual  focuses, o ne of the case  studies features  the work of the UMN\u2122s  Urban Research  and Outreach -Engagement Cen ter  (UROC) , which  embodies  the University\u2122s commitment  to improving lives in urban communities. The second case  study, the outreach program from the School of Dentistry, strives to  address a set of important  rural issues  by  expanding residents\u2122  access to h igh quality dental care  and for strengthening the health care  professional workforce across the state.  The third case study showcases the University\u2122s  commitment to  bridging the gap between the lab and the marketplace  in ways that  connect faculty  and  compa nies to  achieve  joint  results by  transferring  the UMN  research to licensees for development of new products and  services that benefit the public good, foster economic growth and generate revenue to support the   University\u2122s research and education goals.  The  campus team  involved in this APLU CICEP effort  defines  \ufb01innovation\ufb02  as a means for the  University to conduct  research and teaching in ways that go beyond traditional epis temologies and  methodologies.  F aculty members\u2122 increased utilization of community -based participatory research or  students\u2122 engagement in service -learning are two examples  of more innovative and contemporary  approaches to research and teaching .  Along with this, the team believes that innovation suggests that  higher education, as a sec tor,  needs to  move beyond its traditional ivory tower approach to work  and more  fully and genuinely engage community partners  from public and private sectors as co -investigators and  
p2762
aV 2 co-educators  in its everyday work. In regards to economic prosperity, the  campus team defines it as the  assurance that all communities across the state can thrive through self -sufficiency, empowerment, and  collective action.    II. Process Experience.   In order to ensure  a collaborative  process of assessing university -community econo mic engagement , the campus assessment team adapted  the  CICEP Assessment Tools  and transformed them  into a focus  group protocol  that was  then  administered to  key  internal and external stakeholders . For the focus groups,  the  campus team  convened  groups of internal and external stakeholders  (each group associated with  each  of the  case study identified ) to represent the University of Minnesota\u2122s  innovation, community  engagement, and  economic development efforts.  The focus group moderator asked each  team  of  representatives  to discuss each question  on adapted protocol  and  jointly assign a rating  (based on the  CICEP tool scales)  of how  well the University  is performing on  each function  listed in the protocol.  They  were also asked to assign a group  rat ing  on how important  they  feel that  function  is to supporting  economic development . The process of discussing each question as a group  and then jointly coming up  with a  rating  (based on the CICEP tool scales)  helped the stakeholders  engage in a conversatio n about the  University\u2122s  overall  performance  on each item  and  the  steps that need to be taken  for improvement.  The  focus groups interviews also gave the campus assessment team rich data for analysis of the University\u2122s  economic development efforts and thei r importance and alignment with University\u2122s strategic mission.   In the area of institutional leadership, internal stakeholders rated the University\u2122s performance as  fair . The group believes that there is great leadership around engagement, which would include economic   development to some extent.  While  the University  has  a designate person or unit to lead economic  development efforts , this unit is not led by a faculty memb er and therefore has limited status among the  collegiate units.   As one internal stakeholder commented: \ufb01There are multiple projects involving   economic development that are happening at the U of M but they are not tied to one institutional leader or   even a  group of leaders\ufb02.   
p2763
aV 3 The University\u2122s performance was rated as  good in creating a culture that supports community  engagement work for economic development. There are a lot of units on campus who are involved in and  supportive of this work. However, it is  not easy  to find  the  faculty who are willing to apply their research  to societal issues . As an internal stakeholder noted: \ufb01Economic development work is not institutionalized   across the University. The Office for Public Engagement  has  created the culture of  engagement , but those  who do economic development work do not approach it through an engagement lens\ufb02.   In the area of creating a culture that supports community engagement work for economic  development, the internal group rated the items in this area bet ween  good  and  superior . As one internal  stakeholder commented: \ufb01We have a ways to go to meet that expectation in health. When we looked into  starting a clinic in Willmar, we came out of the community meeting with local dentists. They didn\u2122t trust  us. They  didn\u2122t think we\u2122d stay. Now, 6 -7 years later, we are partners. Now they say that they know the  University\ufb02.  Such relationship building is a centerpiece of the Dental School\u2122s engagement programs , which is described in our case study .  In the area of commu nity benefits and educational opportunities for students , the internal group rated  the University\u2122s performance as  good. There are  several  units  at the UMN  that  have self -identified as  units that do economic development through a community -engaged lens. F or example,  the University -District  Alliance,  the  Center for Urban and Regional Affairs (CURA), UMore Park, and many others  are  robust units that involve students, faculty, and community partners in a variety of projects and initiatives.    The internal stakeholders expressed concern that it is difficult to  assess community benefits because there  are no  universally agreed -upon measures  that can be applied  systematically  across the University to  assess  impact. One of the internal stakeholders  stated: \ufb01This question ties together with the first question about   the University leadership: the University must have a leader who would take a charge of this work and   work on institutionalization of economic development\ufb02. Another internal stakeholder not ed: \ufb01Regarding  the educational opportunities, the University works really hard to engage undergraduate students in   working with community. But more work needs to be done to increase support for graduate  students who  want to do engagement \ufb02.   
p2764
aV 4 One item to not e is that both internal and external stakeholders agree that the University\u2122s  performance in promoting openness, accessibility, and responsiveness as it pertains to its relationship  with the community should be rated as  good ; this was considered as area in  which the University can do  better. In terms of communicating contributions, successes, and achievements that benefit the region both   external and internal stakeholders rated University\u2122s performance between  fair  and  good. One of the  internal group member s said: \ufb01We are aware that we have this problem  \u0152 communicating our successes  \u0152 and it hasn\u2122t been solved yet. We don\u2122t have people to tell our story\ufb02.  Another internal stakeholder stated:   \ufb01The message about this important work gets lost in the maze of eve rything that\u2122s going on at such a big  decentralized University.\ufb02  The external stakeholders rated the University\u2122s performance in engaging with and promoting regional  innovation and economic growth initiatives, creating and encouraging innovation and partne rships, linking  University resources to public needs, contributing to regional economic development, openness,  accessibility, and responsiveness between  good  and  excellent.  University\u2122s hands -on involvement with the  economic development initiatives through  UROC, School of Dentistry,  the Office for Technology  Commercialization , along with other units,  helped community organizations foster partnerships with the  City and local industry. In terms of importance of  these partnerships , all of  the areas were rated as  very  important  by internal and external stakeholders . III. The Economic Engagement Enterprise .  The  University of Minnesota is  one of the  few  land grant universities  located in  a large, metropolitan  community . This unique setting makes it possible for the University faculty and students to study first -hand the housing, education, health and economic development issues commonly associated with urban  settings. It has also enabled the University to better underst and how to focus efforts over the years to  fulfill its original land -grant mission to promote higher education as a way to foster learning, discovery  and  engagement  for the public good.  In 2004, the UMN launched a comprehensive Urban Agenda, which  focuses  attention on  strengthening and deepening  a broad array of contributors to  urban  economic  prosperity \u0160from financial wealth  (e.g., Office for Business and Community Economic Development,  
p2765
aV 5 University of Minnesota Extension)  to development of human and social c apital  (Urban Research and  Outreach -Engagement Center, University District Alliance)  and to nurturing community and cultural  assets  (Cedar -Humphrey Action for Neighborhood Collaborative Engagement, Center for Urban and  Regional Affairs ). The mentioned centers are just a sample of many units  identified in the urban agenda  that are  working on  advancing  economic development of the region.  While the  University of Minnesota does not have an established definition for  economic engagement,  it has  a formal,  institutionalized definition of public engagement , which has economic engagement as  one  of its  central feature s. At the University of Minnesota, public engagement is  \ufb01the partnership of university  knowledge and resources with those of the public  and private sectors to enrich scholarship, research, and  creative activity; enhance curriculum, teaching and learning; prepare educated, engaged citizens;  strengthen democratic values and civic responsibility; address critical societal issues; and contrib ute to the  public good. \ufb02 The  University\u2122s Ten -Point Plan for Advancing and Institutionalizing Public Eng agement,  produced in June 2008 (updated in May 2012)  identifies specific action steps  the University will take to  serve the community by seeking innovat ing ways to spearhead economic development of the region  (see  http://engagement.umn.edu/10_point_plan ) .  Going through the CICEP assessment process  brought to light  not only the strengths but also some of  the  weaknesses  of the University \u2122s work  on economic development. Bringing  together  community  organizations, representatives from the city admini stration, and industry into the discussion helped our  team  learn about the positive  impact s that external stakeholders say  the University has on building  community organization capacity,  attracting businesses to  impoverished neighborhoods and  rural  Minnesota , and leveraging additional  resources for community needs. The assessment process also  unveiled to the campus team  the  University\u2122s  weaknesses  in coordi nating its work across particular  societal  issues and geographic areas , in systematically  assessing  the  impact s of economic engagement,  and  in effectively  articulating their successes to the targeted audience . These are the issues that  our  campus  team cons idered in developing  its action plan.   
p2766
aV 6 IV.  Economic Engagement Planning.   The University\u2122s Ten -Point Plan for Public Engagement focuses on integration community -engaged  practices into the research and  teaching  work of  academic units.  With economic development as one of  the University\u2122s ongoing priorities, more of the economic -focused engagement work in occurring within  academic units (e.g., colleges and departments) and is being integrated more fully into undergraduate and  graduate deg ree programs.  For example, o ne of  the UMN  case studies  presented  exemplifies the outreach  program of the School of Dentistry  in which  students learn how to  expand access of  high quality  dental  care  to underserved communities , work with other health profess ions students (e.g., dental hygiene), and  learn to work with diverse patient populations in rural and urban areas .  Our  campus team has  identified three areas for  improvement, which are further  detailed in t he Growth  and Improvement Plan:  Goal 1 : Improving  access to high quality health care to rural areas in the region   Goal 2 : Internal alignment of community and economic engagement efforts to help maximize the  application of existing resources in ways that promote collective action for impact optimization   Goal 3 : Establish ing  system -wide metrics for assessing progress and impact of our economic  development efforts   These goals build on the existing infrastructure at the UMN that has supported the advancement of  economic engagement.  Some of this  infrastructure includes the assessment of the University\u2122s economic  contribution to the state, which is calculated each year using a broad range of data points and a complex  formula that weights particular factors that promote regional economic development . In addition, the  University has formally designated  (through a competitive grant program)  20 academic units as \ufb01Engaged  Departments\ufb02. Each of these departments has developed and is implementing a strategic initiative to   embed community engagement more fu lly into their research and teaching activities  (http://engagement.umn.edu/engaged_departments ).  The majority  of these units are working on urban -focused  issues that  are advancing the  economic and social  needs of underserved populations.   In 2007, the  Uni versity revised its promotion and tenure guidelines, which encourage more community -engaged  research, teaching, and scholarship.   
p2767
aV 7  V. Promotion and Communication.   The  campus team identified local government and community partner as the  main  stakeholder group  to target for communication and promotion . Communicating successes and econo mic impact to the  government helps the University  secure  needed funding for research, teaching, and outreach efforts that  support economic engagement . Communicating  with community  organizations and community members  is important because it confirms the University\u2122s commitment to working  in partnership  with  the  community  and it helps the UMN  tell about the accomplishments that University -community partnerships  can achieve.  Our  team  found that the  University  can do much  more  to communicate  the succe sses and  accomplishments of  the UMN\u2122s  community -engaged  partnerships. The gap in this area has a lot to do  with the lack of  a unifying metric system that  can effectively and comprehensively  measure the impact of  the community and economic engagement initiatives.   Many  units tell their  individual  engagement stories through annual reports, single project evaluations,  highlights of economic engagement initiatives on their web -sites and in printed communication tools.  For  instance, the Office for Technology Commercialization, featured in one of our ca se studies, produces an  annual report for the Board of Regents telling about their successes and the areas for  growth:  http://www.research.umn.edu/documents/2012Report.pdf . Another center  on the forefront of  community and economic development, Center for Urban and Regional Affairs publishes  CURA Reporter   three times annually to provide information about CURA's programs, projects, and publications.  The  Office of Business and Community Econo mic Development publishes an online quarterly newsletter with   the latest updates on their projects and   programs:  http://www.bced.umn.edu/forms/Newsletter%20February%202013.pdf . These examples are  just a fraction of communication  materials produced by multiple units. The next step for advancement  would be to develop a more centralized reporting system that comprehensively measures impacts across  multiple initiatives.

aV 8 VI.  Advancing University Economic Engagement.   The University of Minnesota represents its community an d economic engagement efforts through its  involvement and affiliation with a number of regional, national, and international association focused on  campus -com munity collaboration, community -building, commercialization, and economic development.   Along with participation in APLU (through CICEP, Council on Engagement and Outreach, and Senior  Administrative leadership), the UMN also shared its economic engagement  accomplishments and   struggles with other groups and associations including  the  Coalition of Urban  Serving Universities , Committee on Institutional Cooperation,  Talloires Network, Engagement Scholarship Consortium,  AACU, AASCU,  Global University Network for  Innovation  (GUNI), Australian Universities Community  Engagement Association (AUCEA)  among  others.  The University \u2122s community engagement and/ or  economic development work have  been profiled in publications produced by these associations and in  presentation  at their annual meetings .  For example, most recently, t he University\u2122s Public Engagement  Agenda was presented at the international meeting of  GUNI , held in Barcelona, Spain in May.

aV 9 UNIVERSITY OF MINNES OTA Case #1  School of Dentistry   As the state\u2122s  only dental school, the University of Minnesota School of  Dentistry  continues to   have  a significant impact on the region. It not only educates 95% of the dentists in the state, but  it has increased access to quality dental  care  for tens of thousands of Mi nnesota residents through  a broad range of  off -site outreach  rotations . It is a current requirement for graduation that  dental,  dental therapy, and dental hygiene students complete between 8 -11 weeks of dental  outreach in  their senior year . While on rotati on, students are  providing  needed dental services to a variety of  patients, including underserved populations, in contemporary off -site clinical settings.  Students  have several opportunities to fulfill this requirement through rotations with community -base d clinics including the Mobile Dental Clinic (MDC); Community University Health Care Center  (CUHCC); Hibbing Community College Dental Clinic  (HCCDC); Native American Community  Clinic -Dental  (NACC);  Prairie Winds Dental Clinic; and Rice Regional Dental  Clin ic(RRDC);  Cass Lake Hospital; Min -No-Aya -Win Health Center; Red Lake Hospital; White  Earth Health Center; Chief Redstone Health Clinic; and Quentin N. Burdick Memorial Health  Care Facility.  Most of these clinics are located in underserved communities and o ffer residents a  limited set of dental services.  In addition to these rotations,  dental, dental therapy, dental hygiene  students and faculty  volunteer their time to treat patients at the Union Gospel Mission Dental  Clinic  on Tuesday  and  Wednesday  evenings.   Since the inception of the Dental School\u2122s Outreach electronic database in 2007, 189,847 patient  visits have been recorded by the students from the School of Dentistry providing care in the  community -based outreach clinics, as shown in the graph below.  Figure 1: Individual Patient Visit Counts 1

aV 10 Since inception of the outreach database, sixty percent of the population served by School of  Dentistry students were white (60%) followed by black (14%), Hispanic (13%), Native  American (7%), and Asian (2%) amon g others. In terms of age composition, the most numerous  age group served by community -based dental clinics were children ages 0 -14, as shown in Figure  2.   Figure 2: Age Ranges (July 1, 2007 -June 30, 2013)    One of the School\u2122s signature community engagement programs is the  UCare  Mobile Dental  Clinic (MDC),  in which students and faculty travel throughout the state  to address the needs of  patients in underserved communities.  Since its inception, the total patient visit count on the MDC  is 30,200 (serving UCare members in the state of Minnesota).  Through  the  MDC, students and  faculty provide state of the art preventive and primary dental care services to children and adults  who  otherwise would not have access to care.  The  MDC initiative provides opportunities for  dental students to become familiar with patient management, develop an awareness of patients  from diverse backgrounds who have been underserved by dental care,  and it a llows them  to  identify the varied nature of dental needs in various communities of the state.   Another signature engagement program in the School is the Hibbing Community College Dental  Clinic, which is located approximately 200 miles north of the Twin Cit ies campus.  Between July  2007 and June 2013 HCC Dental Clinic patient visits totaled 34,239.  A joint venture between the  University of Minnesota and the Hibbing Community College (HCC), the clinic operates in  collaboration with the existing dental assistan ce program at HCC. The dental students assigned  to this clinic become familiar with the characteristics of a rural practice and underserved  populations whereby they practice developing comprehensive dental treatment plans.  School of Dentistry students prov ide all the patient dental care in  a 10 chair dental clinic  (Rice  Regional Dental Clinic)  within Rice Memorial Hospital where students work as a team on  community engagement activities that address the dental needs of Somali immigrants and other  underserve d groups across several counties.  The research reveals  that as a result of this practice  students  report  an increase in compassion  for  patients as well as greater appreciation for the  05000 10000 15000  20000  25000  30000  35000

aV 11 issues surrounding the access to care in the state  of Minnesota . RRDC is  the clinic that serves the  largest number of patients. Since its inception students have provided exceptional dental care.  The total patient visit count from July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2013 is 59,248. In addition to  providing dental care, RRDC students  conduct oral health and career outreach presentations in  K-12 system, prenatal education and community programs. Between February 2011 and 2012,  RRDC students conducted 32 presentations reaching 2,713 people.    The Dental Outreach program has both direct  and indirect economic impact for the state, its  population, and local communities.  Since its inception all approved treatment fees charged to all  outreach sites are $ 19,065,700 . The population in rural communities now has access to high  quality, affordabl e dental and preventative dental care. Community partners also reported being  impacted by the presence of outreach dental clinics. The influx of patients from neighboring  rural areas increases profit for local business owners.

aV 12 University of Minnesota (Case #2)  Urban Research and Outreach -Engagement Center (UROC)  Overview  The University of Minnesota Urban Research and  Outreach -Engagement Center (UROC), located at  the historic intersection of Plymouth and Penn Avenues in North Minneapolis, is a place -based  organization that catalyzes mutually beneficial, results driven community -University  partnerships.  UROC is a place -based unit on the forefront of the University\u2122s \ufb01urban agenda\ufb02 that  leverages University resources and efforts to maximize a positive impact on Minnesota's urban core  as part of the University's 21st  Century land grant mission.   Now in its fourth year, UROC 's research and outreach activities  are guided by core principles of  alignment, partnership, access and accountability, excellence, equity -mindedness focused on  three,  community identified priority areas: economic and community development, health and well ness,  and education and lifelong learning.    UROC works to build innovative and respectful collaborations that also serve as new models of  urban community development. An early, major collaboration was the Broadband Access Project  (BAP) a three year, $3.6 -million initiative to improve high -speed internet (broadband) access,  awareness, and use in four federally designated poverty zones in Minneapolis and St. Paul. The  project supported development and enhancements of 11 community -based public computer  center s for underserved populations, including African -Americans, Latinos, American Indian, and  Asian and African immigrants. After  over 90,000  visits and  15,000 hours of  workshops and classes,  the BAP project was transferred as planned to its community partners  in 2013.   Current research and outreach projects include: the UROC community -engaged Job Creation Team;  action research on juvenile sex trafficking, violence prevention and mortgage foreclosure; a two -year commitment to building partnerships to address ch ildhood trauma; door -to-door survey work  for the Northside Achievement Zone's (NAZ) Promise Neighborhood project , and  a contract with  NAZ to develop new modules for the Family Academy pipeline of family education.  Economic Development  UROC\u2122s Northside Job  Creation Team (NJCT) is a collaboration representing some of the major   stakeholders in North Minneapolis including UROC, City of Minneapolis, Governor\u2122s Industrial Job  Commission, Minneapolis Public Schools, the African American Faith Community, Pillsbury  United  Communities and the local business community.   The team researches and identifies businesses  that could potentially attract public/private investments in North Minneapolis with the goal of   creating sustainable living wage jobs in or near the Northsi de. At present, North Minneapolis\u2122s  unemployment rate is 16.8 percent \u0160 9.2 percentage points more than Minnesota\u2122s unemployment  rate of 7.6 percent. NJCT is working with a local processor of fresh fruit and vegetables on a   business relocation strategy that  could result in fuel and utility savings for the company, while  reducing North Minneapolis employment by 1.4 percent.   Other  projects include  feasibility

aV 13 assessments of the manufactured home, office space and packaging markets for the North  Minneapolis ar ea.   Business Development Services (BDS) works with pre -venture, new start -up, and established  businesses to help them master business fundamentals, build capacity, improve their performance   and profitability, increase innovation, enhance learning, and dev elop the leadership skills used by  successful business executives. Part of the University\u2122s Office of Business and Community Economic  Development, BDS leverages the internal resources and assets of the University in coordination  with the resources and expe rtise of external community partners to meet the needs and interests of  business clients. BDS builds on BCED\u2122s established strengths in management and technical  assistance to small businesses, expanding to provide additional educational, legal, and account ing  resources/tools; workshops and seminars; and training and direct coaching support. Support  services cover three key functional areas: training and education, capacity development programs,  and consultative services.  Community Health  UROC-based Minnesot a Urban A rea  Health  Education  Center  was established in fall 2009 to  strengthen the connections between the health professions programs at the University of   Minnesota and the North Minneapolis community. The AHEC works along a continuum to increase  the num ber of health professionals providing primary care in the community. This includes  supporting youth with an interest in health careers and creating opportunities for current health  professionals to work in underserved areas throughout the Twin Cities.  Education  Throughout the summer of 2013, UROC is leading data collection for a community survey on behalf  of Minneapolis -based Northside Achievement Zone (NAZ) Promise Neighborhood. The study tracks  changes within the north Minneapolis community as NAZ dra matically scales up its work to  prepare children to graduate from high school ready for college, starting before birth. The work is  supported by a $28 million Promise Neighborhood grant from the U.S. Department of Education.  NAZ's external evaluation team  from Wilder Research hired UROC to serve as the field site to collect  data from a representative sample of more than 400 households. UROC hired and trained 16 college  students and recent graduates as survey takers. Many have connections to the Northside an d all  have gained valuable skills and a deeper knowledge of the community.   UROC -based researchers with the University of Minnesota Center for Early Childhood and  Education (CEED) are developing pre -school parenting strategies for the Northside Achievement  Zone's Family Academy. Family Academy programs deliver high -impact strategies to parents aimed  at building a culture of academic achievement in the home. Targeted to parents of preschoolers, the  academy's 4 -5 Ready to Succeed! Project focuses on the devel opment of school readiness skills in  children, while emphasizing the role of parents in building a supportive and successful  environment for educational, social and behavioral success.

UROC\u2122s initiatives have both direct and indirect economic impact for North  Minneapolis businesses and residents alike. Pro grams like Business Development Services and  Northside Job Creation Team  have direct economic impact for local business and residents by  aiding local business development and bringing more jobs to the area. Programs on education and   community health have a n indirect economic impact for the community members by providing  training, aiding their education, and providing high quality health services.

aV 15 University of Minnesota (Case #3)  Technology Commercialization   The University of Minnesota has a very  successful technology commercialization operation,  measured in the number of disclosures, patent filings, licenses issued, and start -up companies , As  shown in Table 3 below .    Table 3:  University Technology Commercialization Data   FY 2008  FY 2009  FY 2010  FY 2011  FY 2012  Disclosures  217  244  255  250  321  New U.S. Patent Filings  52  65  66  78  115  New Licenses  63  44  67  76  71  Startups  2 3 8 9 12  Current Revenue Generating  Agreements  281  306  399  457  426  Gross Revenues  $86.9  $95.2  $83.8  $10.1  $45.70  Non -Glaxo  Revenues  $7.9  $8.7  $8.6  $10.1  $10.74  Outgoing Material Transfer  Agreements  67  106  171  271  313    This is the result of several very fortuitous factors, but hinges upon the U of M\u2122s ability and  eagerness to be the catalyst that transforms independent  factors into a new whole, more valuable  than the sum of its parts.  First, Minnesota is fortunate to be the home to many leaders in a number  of industries, especially in high technology areas, such as medical devices and robotics. These  industries help to s hape the research environment by providing opportunities for graduate  students and financial support for faculty research. Because of these companies\u2122 ability and  experience in bringing new products to market, their innovative spirit fosters an avid intere st in the  cutting edge research and discoveries of the U of M\u2122s faculty. With their readiness to convert basic  science into practical products, these companies provide an important factor in the success of the  technology commercialization program.   Another  key component is the presence of talented students. There is a wealth of strong programs  in science and technology in the State\u2122s K  \u0152 12 curriculum.  Minnesota high school students continue  to rank high in standardized testing and demonstrate an eagerness  to bring their talent to the U of  M. Many of the U of M\u2122s biological and physical sciences programs, along with its engineering  programs, are ranked among the highest in the country by both the National Research Council and  the U.S. News and World Report.  This allows the U of M to compete favorably against other research  universities, both private and public, and retain its talent \ufb01at home\ufb02.  Both of these (young talent and entrepreneurial companies) are key ingredients, but it requires  innovative programs  and policies to engage companies and faculty and bridge the divide between  basic discoveries and practical products.    Two such innovations supporting technology commercialization are the Entrepreneurial Leave  Program and the Minnesota Innovation Partnersh ips.  The Entrepreneurial Leave Program  encourages university faculty to take short term leaves to assist companies that are  commercializing faculty discoveries into new or improved products or processes. Requirements  and benefits are similar to other sabb aticals and provide a respite from other academic  responsibilities and the time needed to focus on a singular task.  
p2777
aV 16 The second program, Minnesota Innovation Partnership, or MN  \u0152 IP for short, removes one of the  traditional barriers of university -industry collaboration, the division of yet unrealized income from  intellectual property.   Through MN -IP, companies pay a low,  one -time, upfront fee and receive an exclusive worldwide  licens e to intellectual property, if any,  arising from sponsored research. Companies control all  patent filings associated with the technology develo ped during the research project . Royalties are  re alized by the University only at a very high threshold of sales, should a product with market value  be realized during the partnership.   Companies can choose the more traditional path, but  MN-IP eliminates the uncerta inty of  protracted negotiations that of ten  hold up development in a highly competitive market . Businesses  have responded to MN -IP as an attractive and hassle free way of doing business with the U of MN.

aV 17 Growth/Improvement Plan  (1500 -2000 words)  One primary outcome of conducting the assessment process with the different stakeholders groups  revealed that economic development means different things to different stakeholders. For businesses,  economic development is more about their viability as for -profits entities, and most of their comments  focused their capacity to continue to generate venue and expand their enterprises.  For community  residents, economic development is more about employment opportunities and ways in which economic  development will  help improve conditions in their neighborhoods (e.g., better housing, less crime, etc.)  and advancements in their socio -economic development.  For government agencies, economic  development tended to be about bringing businesses to the community, building  capacity of local  businesses to thrive, and creating job opportunities for residents.  For the university, economic  development included all of the above plus an emphasis on the important role that research plays in  advancing economic development; that is,  the new discoveries of the University are catalysts for  advancing the economic vitality of the region and state.  Consequently, these varied definitions raise   questions about what the focus of the University\u2122s engagement work on economic development shoul d be.    With different definitions for economic development and with array of initiatives undertaken by dozens of   units and centers, it was a challenging enterprise to narrow the areas for growth and improvement to three   goals. The campus -based team used b oth the CICEP assessment tools and the reports from the  University\u2122s Annual Engagement Leaders Retreat, a retreat that convenes the managers, directors, and  coordinators of the more than 200 units and centers at the University that incorporate community -engaged  research, teaching, and/or public service. By relying on both the case study participants and larger  University community represented at the annual retreat, we ensured that the goals identified in this report  are recognized as the areas in need of im provement and are supported by the various administrative and  collegiate levels of the institution.   Goal 1 : Improv e access to high quality health care to rural areas in the region  In northwestern Minnesota the average age of a dentist is 59. The dentist p opulation is shrinking due to  retirement. In the Twin  Cities, there are 66 dentists per  100,000 people. In the rest of the state there are  only 49 dentists per 100,000.  Access to high quality dental care is considered an essential component for  securing a  healthy and vibrant workforce. According to the Dean of School of Dentistry, each dentist   generates $500,00 worth of economic stimulus for a town.   Through its community engagement efforts in  the Dental School, the Uni versity is focus on the areas where th e need is the strongest to grow the dental  industry across the state. One attempt to take the work to next level is work conducted by the University\u2122s   Twin Cities and Duluth campuses to collaborate with communities on the development of a rural  curriculum  to address the dental needs of rural residents. The stakeholders recommended that the  University explore how to develop more rural sites and allow for longer rotations for dental students.   They also recommended that University develop a broad -based rural s trategy for dentistry and work out a  budget model that provides a unique and more flexible financial model that can more fully meet the  evolving and varied needs of the communities in which the program operates.  One primary goal of the  program is to expose  dental students to rural health in the hope that they can situate their practice in these  communities. The School of Dentistry is one of six health professions schools and colleges at the  University of Minnesota (UMN). As we continue this work, we are wor king to bring together internal and  
p2779
aV 18 external stakeholders from all six health professions schools and colleges to measure the need for health  care and health care professionals in rural Minnesota. The plan is to build on the longstanding Area  Health Educat ion Center (AHEC) Network, which brings together the six health professions schools and  colleges and communities in greater  Minnesota to address  key health  professional workforce needs.  The  University\u2122s Academic Health Center in general and AHEC in particu lar have influenced positive  development both in urban and rural communities. Since May of 2012, AHEC has had  291 UMN  students   on rotations in rural  regions throughout the state . In partnership with the University \u2122s health professions  schools and colleges,  the AHEC Network has provided reimbursements to  UMN  students participating in  rural rotations with a population of 30,000 or less, to help offset the costs associated with travel a nd housing in a rural location. B etween February 2008 and April 2013, the  AHEC Network distributed more  than $722,000 to UMN health professions students to support their rotations in rural areas and to   encourage them to consider practice in rural and urban underserved Minnesota.  Notwithstanding these  efforts, the need for licens ed health professionals still exists. We hope to reduce this need by providing  the Academic Health Center administrative support in their efforts.  Goal  2: Strengthen internal  align ment of  community and economic engagement efforts  at the  University  to help  maximize the application of existing resources in ways  that  promote collective  action for impact optimization  A measure of community and economic engagement quality and institutionalization is the extent to which  there is coordination and alignment across  an institution\u2122s community and economic engagement projects,  programs, and initiatives. Internal alignment of community engagement efforts helps maximize the   application of existing resources in ways that promote collective action for impact optimization.  At the  University of Minnesota, community and economic engagement is operationalized within and across ore  than 200 academic and non -academic units, offices, institutes, colleges, and departments. While having  such widespread participation indicates strong  institutional involvement in and commitment to  community and economic engagement, it brings with it several challenges that hinder the University\u2122s  capacity to advance its engagement efforts including those connected to economic engagement. It  particular,  a decentralized and diffused approach to community and economic engagement:    Creates challenges in measuring the scale, scope, and collective impact of the University\u2122s  engagement work on students, faculty, the community, and the institution;   Creates chal lenges in applying limited resources in ways that will ensure operational excellence;   Mitigate supplication of efforts or addressing gaps in program areas;   Creates competition between units for limited resources for programming;   Challenges community  partners that must develop different partnership agreements with various  units at the University;   Makes it difficult for students, faculty, community partners, and other stakeholders to locate  engagement information, activity, and resources;   Limits the Uni versity\u2122s capacity to assess the collective impact of its engagement work.  Given the inherent structure and entrepreneurial spirit of higher education, decentralized programming for  community and economic engagement is inevitable and not unwelcome. However , much can be done at  the institutional level to deepen, strengthen, and further support the various independent engagement  efforts in ways that they individually and collectively contribute to a broader set of institutional outcomes.

aV 19 The \u201aPublic Engagemen t Issue Hubs\u2122 and \u201aEngagement Zones\u2122 initiatives are two University -wide efforts  to strengthen the internal alignment of existing public engagement work and to establish a more  coordinate, system approach to community and economic engagement. The Public En gagement Issue  Hubs initiative is an effort to network existing community and economic engagement efforts that are  working on the same societal issues but operate independently across various offices, units, and  departments. As its name implies, the initia tive focuses on establishing a set of hubs focused on different  societal issues (one of them being economic engagement) that then develop a broad -based agenda that  articulates the University\u2122s focus, goals, aspirations, and actions to address those societa l issues. The  Public Engagement Issue Hubs initiative will encourage the building of a more coordinated approach to  economic engagement by networking existing research, teaching, and public service efforts focused on  economic engagement and economic develo pment of the region. Each hub will emphasize collective  action and will focus on assessing the cumulative impact of the various individual engagement efforts on  economic engagement and development. The Engagement Zone initiative is going to be operationali zed  very similar to the Issue Hubs initiative, but instead of focusing on a societal issues, it will focus on  building coordination and collective action across units working within a geographic area.  Goal  3:  Establish system -wide metrics for assessing pro gress and impact of our economic  development efforts  The University of Minnesota has underway a broad -based effort to establish system -wide metrics for  assessing progress and impact of our research, teaching, and outreach programs. The development of   these  system -wide metrics is part of a comprehensive strategic planning effort  tied a University -wide Ten -Point Plan for advancing and institutionalizing public engagement . The University is  increasingly being  called upon to provide data and information on the  scale, scope, and impact of the University\u2122s public  engagement activities. Community leaders and community residents, legislators, funders, and others want   to know where we are in their communities, what  the UMN is  doing, and what the impacts are both for  the community and for the University.  In response, the Office for Public Engagement convened a  Public Engagement Metrics committee to  establish the University\u2122s metrics priorities for community -engaged initiatives. The charge to the  Committee was to:   devel op a prioritized, phased plan for instituting a comprehensive metrics system for public  engagement;    align public engagement initiatives with strategic goals of the University\u2122s overarching metrics  framework;    connect public engagement metrics to relevant  data collection and measurement systems  facilitated by other units and entities both within and external to the University; and   build a long -term strategy for assessing the impact of public engagement on students, faculty,  staff, collegiate units, and the  external community.  Given a list of the University\u2122s strategic goals and the associated public engagement goals, the Committee  developed a list of public engagement activities that address those goals, and possible data sources to  measure the impact of tho se activities.   One of the  University \u2122s Strategic Priorit ies is  Dynamic Outreach  and Service  with the  University  strategic g oal  to  connect the University\u2122s academic research and teaching  as an engine of positive change for addressing society\u2122s most complex  challenges.  The  Public

aV 20 Engagement Goal  corresponding to the University Strategic Goal is to a ddress critical societal issues and  contribute to the public good through community -engagement initiatives.  As we have mentioned above,  economic engagement effort s fall under a broader category of public and community engagement, thus  aligning with these Strategic and Public Engagement Goals. The Committee came us with the following  measures that capture the impact of community and economic engagement projects and  initiatives:   Description, location, and duration of engaged outreach projects   Evidence of  economic and other  contribution to local, state, region, nation, and world   Evidence that community defined goals were fulfilled   Documentation of unintended consequenc es

aV1     University of Missouri   Application for the Association of Public and Land - grant Universities (APLU) Innovation and  Economic Prosperity Award     NARRATIVE   Introduction   I n 2003,  P resident   Elson Floyd  added   economic development as a di stinctive mission,     missions of teaching, research, and outreach.  Since then,  MU has had successes with economic  development and  prosperity   through the coordinated efforts of the office of Economic Development and  the innovative Mizzou Advantage initiative.  Al though we have had these successes and others as  demonstrated in our  Exemplary Accomplishments   section , MU recognizes that there is still work to be  done.    In particular,  we are looking for additional ways to create a more streamlined process   and  infrastructure  to support innovation and excellence.   Within this application, we have several examples of     and improvement of quality of life.   MU i s innovative in the promotion and execution of its core  competencies with in the Mizzou Advantage, and  fosters  interdisciplinary  collaborations between campus  faculty and departments, with other national institutions and globally.  MU strives for e conomic pr osperity  by creating jobs within the region, by fostering collaboration be tween the arts and the sciences, and  supporting entrepreneurial efforts.   Award Process Experience    and regularly  engaged with numerous   groups  and organizations  to learn and share together how to better tackle the challenges and opportunities to enhance our world.  This engagement defines how MU contributes, responds and plans.  T he CICEP Assessment Tool was  administered to both internal and extern al groups in o rder to assess MU  innovation.    Internally, the survey was sent to 510 individuals from  various MU departments.   The  external assessment was sent to   99   individuals from  a variety of economic development organizations,  such as the  Re gional Economic Development Incorporated   (REDI)   and  Missouri CORE (Co nnecting Our  Regional Economy).

aV2     Goal 2: Build the Mizzou Advantage, a set of focused, interdisciplinary initiatives that capitalize on  existing strengths and bring new international distinction to MU.   Goal 3: Ensure that MU has the i nfrastructure and human and financial resources necessary to support  innovation and excellence in teaching, research, outreach and economic development.     Within each of those goals are numerous objectives. We chose to focus on objectives that had direct l inks  to statemen ts within the CICEP assessment where we did well ( Exemplary Accomplishments ) and not so  well ( Areas for Growth   and Improvement ).   The APLU IEPA process complemented other   ongoing   efforts on campus to examine and strategically  focus our efforts to maximize our ability to secure external funding, recruit top students, attract prominent  scholars and scientists, create jobs, and improve quali ty of life.

aVIn  2006 , Provost  Brian  Foster  defined  economic engagement  to  go beyond extension, outreach and public  service.  E conomic engagement   was based on partnerships that are defined by mutual respect that enhance  our economic vitality and quality of life.  In  short, Mizzou is a source of innovation, creativity, and  entrepreneurship through   all four missions across the entire institution within these   three specific roles   (see diagram 1).
p2788
aV MU is an economic enterprise.    The university's strategic contribution  i s the mutually  beneficial   exchange of knowledge and resources  to the vitality and growth of the state and regional economy  as  reflected in its roles as a  major employer,  s tate  resource multiplier , creator of new knowledge,  commercializ er of  innovations , an d  enhanc er of   economic and social capital.    MU supports economic enterprises.   The university ,   in collaboration with public and private sectors ,   produces a n engaged and   high - quality workforce for Missouri, awarding the largest number of  undergraduate, grad uate and professional degrees in the state.    MU provides extensive support  and  knowledge exchange  for new venture and existing businesses   in cooperation with the public and private  sectors to enrich creative activity.  Credit and non - credit offerings are accessible for  continuing  professional development opportunities to Missourians.     MU supports state and local economic development.   The university positively contributes to an  improved quality of life through research ,  teaching, service and economic development mission s   by  working together a) with economic development organizations to attract and retain companies, b) with  organizations to develop public policies to enhance economic vitality and address critical societal  issues,  and c) with people and organizations to enhance our quality of life through health services, sporting  events, cultural venues, civic responsibility, and  numerous  contributions to the public good.   These three roles are overseen by the Office of Econ omic Development.  Steve Wyatt, the Vice Provost  for Economic Development ,   coordinates two important advisory boards to the institution.   The Econom ic  Development Cabinet , which   includes both internal and external  key  stakeholders,   such as the  Chairman,  Missouri Biotechnology Association , the  Director, Missouri Technology Corporation   and  President,  Regional Economic Development   Incorporated, to name a few.   The Economic Development Council is  made up of community leaders and senior faculty members who cha ir campus - wide working groups for

p2790
aV   O ur strengths are that our leaders have  thought intentionally about the roles that M U   plays in economic  development and have developed  innovative  strategic initiatives to carry out those roles.    Three key  strengths have been our Mizzou Advantage, Economic  Engagement and   Entrepreneurial Learning.   Mizzou Advantage :  Prio r to the APLU IEPA process,  MU   had undertaken a strategic effort, known as the  Mizzou Advantage, to   MU  develop ed   internal and external networks and collabor ations around four  interdisciplinary  areas of  strength:  1) Food for the Future, 2) Media of the Future, 3) One Health/One Medicine, and 4) Sustainable  Energy.   A key mission of  Mizzou Advantage is to bring together faculty from different disciplines acros s  campus to collaborate and innovate.   With a wide array of expertise and resources all located on the same  campus, MU does things no other university can.   MU is uniquely qualified to do translational cancer  research due, in part, to the close proximity a nd collaboration across campus from the basic sciences to  the veterinary school, medical school, and research reactor.   By focusing on real - world problems   utilizing   our collaborative networks ,   MU   is better able to   secure external funding, recruit top stude nts, attract  prominent scholars and scientists, create jobs, and improve quality of life.  An educational component  within each of the four areas develops and nurtures student - driven programs  that are also highly  interdisciplinary  and gives  MU   students a c    Economic Engagement :   The  Economic Engagement has allowed MU to engage with the public and  private sectors .  For example, through collaborative b usiness attraction initiatives  an IBM data center   expanded in to the   region .  MU established a technology business incubator , awarded the NBIA Soft  Landings designation,   to support economic development in mid - Missouri, creating high - paying jobs and  
p2791
aV4     attracting capital investment.  MU is instrumental in  taking res earch   from bench to market, as  can be seen  in our case study #2 of the exemplary accomplishments, Beyond Meat, a soy - based chicken substitute  product now produced in Columbia, Missouri.   Entrepreneurial Learning :    As  an educational institution,  MU   offers key res ources for even the earliest of  entrepreneurs in the areas of business formation and growth.   One such example is  CLIMB  (Collaboration, Leadership and Innovation for Missouri Business)  that  allows students to learn about  entrepreneurship and give back to the community by securing funds for the largest Seed Grant  competition in Missouri.  Another example is the Entrepreneurship Alliance, which is designed to nurture  entrepreneurship characteri stics, such as a passion for business; a knack for innovation; initiative; self - confidence; tenacity despite failure; and the ability to manage risk, create opportunities, work well within  a team, and handle multiple details.   One success story of entrepre neurial learning is Luis Jimenez, the  CEO of EternoGen,  in  our case  study #3 .   Despite t hese strengths, there are known challenges wit h economic development at MU   as well.  Some of  these are being addressed, as will be highlighted in the  Growth and Improvem ent Plan .  This award  process gave us the opportunity to connect with our internal and external stakeholders again and assess   what was found from the  assessments, with the goals and objectives in our strategic plan, to work that is ,  or will be,   in progress. By following up with the stakeholders post - assessment, we were able to better  ascertain if what we concluded from the assessments was on targ et.

aVT he Mizzou Advantage has enhanced our engagement  significantly , but MU can strength en   and grow our  collaborations with industry   even more . Our Economic Engagement has been very successful with new  startups, company attractions, workforce collaborations, equ ity investments, and licensing  opportunities ,  but these engagements require collaboration and involvement of numerous departments and approvals.  MU has an opportunity to improve with more streamlined and transparent processes to help faculty and  companies  have an easier engagement experience.    Our Extension Business Development program has helped numerous  entrepreneurs   and companies.   From  2010 through 2012, the Missouri Small Business & Technology Assistance Centers assisted clients in:

Building on this success, and incorporating the best practices o f Mizzou Advantage, MU Extension plans  to extend economic development and business development su ccess across disciplines of Extension.   Economic Engagement Planning   Through this award process and our own institutional insight, we are aware of our strengths and  weaknesses.    In our  Growth and Improvement Plan   we address   three issues:    1)  build on the st rength of  the Mizzou Advantage and Office of Economic Development by increasing industry collaborations  through industry tradeshow outreach ,  2)  a persistent challenge of providing a streamlined and transparent,  well - documented process for faculty and compa nies to more easily engage for research, service and  economic development,  and 3) taking the best practices from Mizzou Advantage and applying it to

aV5     Extension.     Along with these activities, others that address economic development are found in the  One  Miz zou: 2020 Vision for Excellence   strategic plan .   Under the first two of the three goals in the strategic  plan there are a group of objectives centered  exclusively  on economic development.   These include:

In addition, e fforts like Mizzou Ad vantage ,   where faculty and researchers are awarded grants through the  university to support research and innovation ,   will potentially lead to a larger grant or investment.    M izzou Advantage has set aside matching, recurring funds to hire 20 faculty members   over the next 5  years. These matches, $50,000 each, will be for positions that strengthen the emerging networks within  Mizzou Advantage areas.     Promotion and Communication   MU has identified 17 major audiences for marketing, including alumni, community me mbers, donors,

aV-    MU   does an excellent job communicating with external   and internal   stakeholders.  The   Mizzou  Measures Up    website  http://measuresup.missouri.edu/   provides a visual display of key facts  demonstrating how the institution impacts the state and region, including measures of economic impact.   Additionally ,   the   Advancing Missouri    website  http://www.umsys tem.edu/about - us   provides both  quantitative measures and anecdotal evidence of the impact of the institution on the economy of counties  throughout the state.  One of the key benefits of the Mizzou Advantage initiative is that it allows us to  take  hundreds  of   stories  of university researchers collaborating with one another and external entities to  innovate  and combine them into four strategic messages.   Since Mizzou Advantage was implemented in  2010, total media hits have increased 141%, from 6,683 in 2009 - 1 0 to 16,091 in 2012 - 13.   The Office of  Economic Development hosts various companies, higher educational institutions, legislators,  entrepreneurs , and potential collaborators through various campus tours targeted to their interests. This  approach has allowe d the region to attract companies, gain tremendous respect for the strengths of MU,  obtain research contracts, and create advocates for MU. An annual Economic Development Report is  dist ributed to key stakeholders  to  publicize   our success es .    MU Leadership and faculty serve on key state, regional, and national organizations and are able to  engage, integrate, and coordinate in a very responsive manner that does not compromise our academic  neutrality.

aV6     Advancing University Economic Engagement   The University of Missouri has participated in the recent APLU CICEP metrics initiative.  This included  meeting with data stewards across campus and collecting data  for a large number of variables   to be  narrowed down after going through a fairly extensive  process.  This process included hosting a regional  conference in which stakeholders were able to provide input into what variables they found useful in  telling the story about the ins titution.  Delegates from MU   and Mike Brooks, President, Regional  Economi c Development Inc., traveled to Washington DC to partake in a national discussion about the  metrics.   In May, 2013, Steve Wyatt again travelled to Washington DC to parta ke in a joint conference  hosted  by APLU and AAU to provide information on how to effect ively measure economic impact.    Additionally, the institution has participated in the APLU Innovation and Economic Prosperity Award.   As participants in the process, we took part in the weekly phone calls, provided templates for a Qualtrics  version of the  assessments, and provided feedback throughout.   MU   has shared best practices with other institutions in APLU, AAU, and SEC. The University is  a  member   in the University Economic Development Association, Missouri Economic Development  Council, Animal Health  C orridor , Kansas City Area Development  Corporation , Regional Growth and  Commerce Association, Kansas City Area Life Science Institute, Regional Economic Development  Incorporated and various other economic development  organizations . Best practices are shared   through  presentations, networking sessions, and c onversations. Higher Education i nstitutions have requested  information  on  how to duplicate our Mizzou Advantage. Companies have requested that our university  and city present on the west coast for how we co ordinate so effectively.

aV7     EXEMPLARY ACCOMPLISHEMENTS   Case Study #1     Mizzou Advantage fosters interdisciplinary collaboration among faculty, staff, students and external  partners to address and solve real - world needs and problems in four areas of strength identified at  MU :   Food for the Future : The culture, economics and pro duction of healthy, affordable food   Media of the Future : New ways to communicate, educate and market   One Health/One Medicine : The convergence of animal and human health   Sustainable Energy : Developing and distributing renewable energy sources   With a wide ar ray of expertise and resources all located on the same campus, MU does things no other  university can.     By focusing on real - world problems, our  collaborative networks   secure extern al funding,  recruit top students, attract prominent scholars and scientists, create jobs, and improve quality of life.  A  great example of Mizzou Advantage is the succes s of Comparative Oncology.   MU   is uniquely qualified  to do translational cancer researc h due, in part, to the close proximity and collaboration across campus  from the basic sciences to the veterinary school, medical school, and research reactor. Meet some of the  experts and researchers doing this pivotal work.   (Comparative Oncology)   http://vimeo.com/61631390   An educational component within each of the four areas develops and nurtures student - driven programs  that are also highly interdisciplinary and gives  MU    s global  marketplace.   Since 2010, Mizzou Advantage has awarded more than $3 million for   interdisciplinary projects which  bring people together and solve real - world problems.     The program also provides financial and logistical  support for conferences and ne twork activities.   One of the greatest benefits of Mizzou Advantage is that it has better enabled the institution to tell its  story about how it contributes to the state and regional economy.  We have taken hundreds of stories  about our researchers, their c ollaborations, their innovations, and the successes of their students, and  focused them on four great, cohesive, strategic areas. Since the inception of Mizzou Advantage, the  number of media hits has consistently been higher, by as much as 149%, than befor e the initiative was  implemented.

aV Source:  MU News Bureau   Our Food For   the Future Advantage had moved innovation to the market and learning collaboration from  the classroom to the plant. Fu - Hung Hsieh, a University of Missouri professor of biological engineering  and food science in the College of Agriculture, Food and Natura l Resources and the College of  Engineering  developed a low - cost soy substitute for chicken.  In 2010, Ethan Brown, CEO of  Savage  River Inc. ,   launched the   Beyond Meat & Trade    brand in 2012.    Brown collaborated with researchers a t  MU and licensed the  techn ology. The company has financial backing from The Obvious Corporation  (including Twitter co - founders), as well as venture capitalist firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. MU,  in collaboration with community leaders, was able to attract their first plant t o the community. Students  from MU are also involved in internships at the facility ,   and faculty continue to collaborate with the  company on new innovations.    Our One Health One Medicine Advantage has seen numerous accomplish ments, too. Organovo, which  rece ntly   went public on the New York Stock Exchange, was founded  by   Professor Gabor Forgacs ,  and  will advance organ printing technology and bring it closer to clinical use.   The University of Missouri  started, grew and sold its animal research diagnostics lab to IDEXX RADIL for $43 million dollars.    Mizzou Advantage has demonstrated that MU is able to mutually engage with private sector companies in  a holistic manner of resea rch, teaching, service and economic development that improves our quality of  life with our interdisciplinary approach. Mizzou Advantage is engagement for today and tomorrow.

aV9     Case Study #2     What came first, the chicken or the soy - bean?   Fu - Hung Hsieh,  a  MU   professor of biological engineering  and food science in the  College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources  and the  College of  Engineering , is leading a project to create a low - cost soy substitute for chicken. His research, funded by  the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Illinois - Missouri Biotechnology Alliance, has led to a process  that does more than just add color and flavor to soy.  Hsieh has spent 20 years researching and developing  the project and he, along with Harold Huff, a senior research associate, developed the process that makes  the soy product simulate the fibrous qualities of a chicken breast.     (Fake Chicken: Turning Powde r into Poultry)     Time Video   http://www.time.com/time/video/player/0,32068,89629092001_1993980,00.html   Hsieh created the soy chicken using soy protein extracted from  soy flour, pea powder, carrot fiber and  gluten - free flour. The protein mixture then goes through an extrusion cooking process that uses water,  heat and pressure before it is extruded into strips. The strips contain no saturated or  trans - fat , no  cholesterol   and no gluten.   (Turning Soybeans into Chicken at Mizzou)   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVn60VJovME&feature=player_embedded   US sales of all soy foods were more than $4.17 b illion in 2008. Meat alternative sales were approximately  $620 million, an increase of 8.3 percent over 2007, according to   Soyfoods: The U.S. Market 2009 . From  2000 to 2007, American food manu facturers introduced more than 2,700 new foods with soy as an  ingredient, including 161 new products introduced in 2007 alone. Once a cottage industry, soy products  are being marketed by industry giants Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland and Kraft.   That is wh y when officials from the City of Columbia and REDI Inc. announced that Savage River Inc.  was going to open a 16,000 square - foot food production facility for its Beyond Meat & Trade brand in  Columbia last fall, everyone was excited.

aV12     Case Study #3     Creativity, Innovation, Learning, and New Venture:   MU   recognizes the growing need to improve patient  care through the invention and development   of new medical technologies.  The MU Biodesign and  Innovation Program's (MUBIP) purpose is to meet this need in health care and invent the future of patient  care thro ugh two tiers: multidisciplinary f aculty collaboration within  MU   and formal education training in  the biodesign process.    One start - up venture that was part of the Biodesign program is EternoGen, and was one of the first start - up companies to receive compe  (EIP).  The EIP was launched after the American economic recession began in 2008 to expedite the   sses and  jobs.  EternoGen was selected following an intensive review of 16 research team applications for funds.   Missouri Technology Corporation, Centennial Investors and the EIP contributed a combined total of  $500,000 to EternoGen to allow it to officia lly launch in March 2012.    Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body, and is the main component in human connective  tissues.     Most people think of collagen soft - tissue filler in cosmetic applications, but current commercial  and experimental use of  collagen soft  - tissue fillers include uses in  urology ,  cardiovascular,   and  orthopedic procedures.    The main drawback of current collagen soft tissue fillers on the market is that they are decomposed by  enzymes such that the implants are effective for a lim ited time.   EternoGen is actively pursuing  commercialization of a novel collagen matrix that reduces the enzymes that cause the filler to decompose,  which in turn, provides improved tissue growth.  EternoGen's innovative collagen scaffold, enhanced by  nan     CEO,  said that the funding the company has received has opened up many necessary  doors for the m.   Before being appointed as the CEO of the new company, Jimenez participated in the College of Business  Crosby MBA program.    Entrepreneurial opportunities, extracurricular activities, and hands - on experience  are combined for a positive experience in the program. Entrepreneurial classes, such as Launch of High - Growth Venture (HGV), enable students to participate in competitions  with high  visibility .  CLIMB  (Collaboration, Leadership and Innovation for Missouri Business) allows students to learn about  entrepreneurship and give back to the community by securing funds for the largest Seed Grant  competition in Missouri.   Finally, Miz zou is one of the few universities in the nation that has a University  Hospital, a Veterinary Hospital ,   a Law   School ,  a College of  Engineering, and Business School on one  campus which  creates   a natural hub for innovation.

In an economic outreach survey,  we found   that an area for growth for the University  is to create  stronger  ties to industry. Enhancing our economic development was communicated to the  University faculty and  staff in the strategic plan. Better linkages between the University and industry are critical to maintain and   Sustainable Energy, Me dia for the Future and Food for the Futur e. Faculty and staff university - wide  understand that to continue to be a leader and educate the work force, MU has to stay relevant to what  is  occurring in industry (e.g. W ha t are current industry problems?   W hat edu cation do the next leader s need  to have to be successful?     W hat research topics could benefit all parties ?) a s well as be involved in  pushing these economies forward. Industry relies on MU for cutting edge research, state of the art  equipment and facilitie s and producing the work force that is the back bone of their companies.    Mizzou is investing in a more aggressive industry outreach plan for each of the four areas of strength. The  following elements are included in that plan:

aVBusiness/industry centric advertis ing and public relations for   MU   have been focused on the four key areas of strengths. Narrowing has and will allow us to optimize  the advertising/public relations human and financial resources.    To know   the program has achieved success, some or all of the following measures need to be met:  maintain or increased national rankings, increased number of corporate partnerships, increased  publications in the four key areas, increased number of grants and grant   submissions, increased  percentage of graduate placements, increased foundation and private donations.    Three barriers to success have been identified.  1)  We have limited amount of human and financial  resources.  2)   In the short - term, measurement perfor mance standards may not be evident due to the time  needed to cultivate and leverage long - term industry relationships and stature.   And, 3) o n a campus which  features  fourteen   colleges and schools, narrowing the areas of strength to just four creates concern s of  exclusion.

aV19     Goal 2:   Improve the administrative processes needed to support innovation and excellence in economic development at MU.    MU recognizes that it must have the administrative infrastructure to support innovation and excellence. For our  second growth  and  improvement g oal, we aim to improve the administrative processes needed to support innovation and excellence in  economic development at MU. Within the section  Award Process Experience , we outlined the information gathering process  w e went through to identify  key issues   that were hindering our ability to move contracts with external organizations through  our administrative processes. The key findings were that there were bottlenecks in the process which were typically caused by   individuals not having clear guidelines to  follow in order to move projects through. Secondly, guidelines being used by  administrative offices to help them move projects through had not received administrative approval which meant that processes   were not transparent. It also meant that the process  could not work efficiently, adding to bottlenecks. Thirdly, publication and  intellectual property waivers, while not impossible to obtain, often caused much discussion and negotiation with sponsors,  again contributing to bottlenecks. Additionally, although   much work has already been accomplished around defining what  economic development at MU included, that information had not been appropriately disseminated and discussed with  stakeholders.   Our administrative processes that support economic development had  been in need of a critical analysis for several years. The  stakeholder interviews highlighted many issues that create impediments. We found that the CICEP assessment tool verified  what we learned from stakeholders.    It is well recognized that our administr ative processes around economic development have  been developed many times as situations arise. As more opportunities arise for MU, this practice cannot be sustained and  developing streamlined and transparent processes will be essential.    An outcome measur e of a streamlined and clear process is federal and industry research dollars generated. MU recognizes that  it lags behind other Midwestern land - grant, public universities who are AAU members, ranked at 7 th  out of 8 in federal research  expenditures and ind ustry research, and 8 th   in total research dollars (Association of University Technology Managers: 2009  Data). In the short term, streamlined processes will translate into decreases in the amount of time it takes to process contr acts.  It may also mean fewer   individuals/offices engaged in the overall process. Long term improvements would manifest as  increases patents, and options and licenses for new technology.
p2825
aVThe barriers begin with leadership. Economic development processes at MU involve many offices.  To change the processes  would require a change management plan, strongly championed by leadership. At MU, we have this with our current Provost  and Chancellor. Those champions, though, must be able to articulate a clear vision for what MU could achieve if  we are able to  improve our economic development processes. This vision will need to be developed. Lastly, creating change through process  improvement does require expertise. MU currently has expertise within the Office of Institutional Research and Quality   Improvement; however, there will be a need to educate key administrative stakeholders with the methods and techniques of  process improvement.

aV22     Goal 3:   Re - conceptualize the role of MU Extension within the Campus and System missions in the furtherance of university  economic engagement through the integration of extension programs related to community, economic, business and workforce  development.     MU Exte nsion recognizes that it has a significant role to play in connecting the research and innovation created at the  university to those that can successfully apply and utilize that knowledge; university stakeholders. For our third  growth/improvement tool, we  seek to expand and strengthen programs that improve the lives of the citizens of Missouri, the  nation and the world through the reconceptualization and reengagement of MU Extension. There were two primary instruments  that informed this decision. First, the   Award Process Experience confirmed that MU Extension had become disconnected from  its on - campus stakeholders, primarily those engaged in applied research. Secondly, a two - year process conducted by Extension  in each of the 114 Missouri counties revealed a  growing sense of irrelevance of the University in the lives of average citizens  on the local level. These findings, when mixed with decreasing financial support for Extension programming identify an  unsustainable trend for MU Extension in the future.   Based   upon the stated needs identified from local stakeholders, and through the alignment of the Extension strategic plan to the  campus and system strategic plan, thematic teams were created within Extension to create focused areas for improvement. The  thematic   teams were patterned after Mizzou Advantage, and addressed the areas of educational attainment, environmental  concerns, global food systems, health, and community, workforce, economic and business development .  Since Extension  programmatic relevance is a s ignificant finding, there is an obvious issue regarding the recognition of Extension within the  organization. Therefore, one of the primary goals of Program Integration is increased recognition and engagement.   While an outcome of the Program Integration pr ocess is the establishment of individual program metrics, the success of the  overarching effort could easily be measured in the increased number of engagements with research faculty and the net increase   in funding inflows from newly - developed strategic par tners.     The time horizon for this effort is three years. In year three, the effort will have been successful if a systems framework i s in  place (based upon the Malcolm Baldridge framework) to allow for the recognition, resource allocation, deployment and  e valuation of new Extension programming within the nexus of campus engagement, community engagement and financial  sustainability.   The three main barriers to successful implementation will be organizational inertia, local stakeholder commitment, and the  rees tablishment of relevance to strategic partners. These barriers are being addressed simultaneously through open, transparent  and focused communication. As previously stated, the current model of Extension is on an unsustainable path. Through the  honest and  open communication of organizational challenges, coupled with a plan for meaningful and sustainable   e  organizational capacity to co mmunicate a succinct, focused message about the complex problem to such a multitude of  stakeholders. These efforts are ongoing.

During the 2014 - 15  academic year, a Business Solutions Director and an Administrative Coordinator were added to th e Industry  Relations staff to manage the rapid growth of managed transactions and relationships, expand internal training  and educational resource development, e.g. SBIR/STTR Handbook, and expand outreach to industry.     NUtech Ventures   is the intellectual p roperty and commercialization unit of UNL. In addition to facilitating the  commercialization and practical use of innovations generated through UNL research, NUtech also connects  innovators with the people, coaching and resources they need to start compani es and develop products. Formerly  the Office of Technology Development until 2009, UNL leadership determined spinning NUtech out of UNL  would facilitate faculty/student start - up activity by allowing NUtech to take equity positions in those companies,  and e nable NUtech to work more easily with invento rs on other NU campuses, and  inventors outside of the  university.

Raikes School of Computer Science and Management is a residential undergraduate honors  program that provides  interdisciplinary  education  at the interface of management and software engineering to  undergraduates with a demonstrated interest in technology and business.  Alongside industry and community  partners, students leverage design and model thinking to develop human - centered solutions to   problems   (see  Figure  7   for   overall approach) .  Student selection is based on high academic achievement, leadership experience,  and a demonstrated interest in technology and business. The School is named for Jeffr e y S. Raikes, native of  Ashland, Nebraska an  .

aV   A key element of the Raikes School education is the Design Studio experience. Students in the Design Studio  integrate concepts from their unique computer science and business curriculum, reinforcing core concepts through  four semesters of hands - on learning . Students gain a head start in their careers by participating in product  development teams, working with real clients to understand complex business requirements, and developing  innovative solutions to challenging problems. The studio model ensures that,  prior to graduation, each student in  the Raikes School has gained the valuable experience of participating in the full software product development  life cycle     from inception of the concept to deployment for the solution.

aVIn addition to developing software solutions for existing  companies   ( Figure  8 ),  this   collaborative environment also fosters  student - founded startups. HUDL is  a   prime example of students  collaborating at the Raikes School, launching an idea, and  creating a significant economic impact for our local community  and region. HUDL was founded  in 2006  by three Raikes students  who developed a platform to share athletic ga me, practice, and  scouting video s   using  new   notebook computing technology .  Today, more than 11,000 high schools, 2,000 youth teams, 800  colleges, 10 NFL teams, eight NHL team s, and one NBA team  utilize   this system.

HUDL has continued to seek Raikes School graduates to staff their  organization ; in    employees and 13 interns per year. Other Raikes alumni can be found working at Google, Microsoft, Amazon ,   and  important local corporations such as Gallup, Mutual of Omaha and Union Pacifi c .     In addition to the student and economic development benefits the Raikes School brings, it has also had a profound  impact across  UNL  ,   is  developing an expanded capston e st udent experience that draws in students and faculty members from   the  Department of Computer Science   and Engineering ,  the  College of Business Administration   (CBA) ,  the  College of  Engineering,  the  College of Journalism and Mass Communication, and  the  Col lege of Architecture. Experiences  will be driven by a project - oriented curriculum and real - world application. The interdisciplinary team  seeks   to  replicate the success of the  innovative  Design Studio  model across other disciplines.

aVA current   pilot project  led by the Raikes School  is the  Pathways to Innovation Program , which will involve   collaboration between the Design Studio,  the  College o f Engineering, and  CBA . Following the development of  the project concept, adjustments will be made for college curriculum requirements, and a teaching team will be  built. The ultimate goal is to develop a more robust innovation and entrepreneurship curricu lum at UNL. Fourteen  other universities across the country are participating in the  Pathways to Innovation Program ,  and our  representatives will add value to the program by sharing their experience  and success  with the Design Studio   model .

Drawing on the intellec tual resources of FS&T and other departments   at UNL, the FPC   is  uniquely able to provide customized stand - alone services or a fully integrated package of technical and business  development support to address the individual needs of its clients, including e ntrepreneurs, manufacturers,  suppliers, retailers ,   and food service providers.  With the Chairperson of FS&T also leading the F PC ,  UNL  processing collaboration with industry and its academic   activities are coordinated   under one roof.     In recent years, the FPC has made  significant   contribution s   to economic  prosperity . From July 1, 2007 to  December 31, 2014, the Center worked with 850 industry clients to complete 2,429 projects for a total  worth of  over $5.4 million.  Two - hundred fifty   of  these clients were Nebraska - based companies.

aV As UNL leadership contemplated the development of Nebraska Innovation Campus (NIC), FS&T was always  considered a critical, if not defining ,    - locatio n   and  similar partnerships on the new campus. What had begun  ten years earlier  as a modest research, advising ,   and  hiring   relationship with ConAgra Foods   ( headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska )   ha s   grown and diversified at UNL  under the active guidance of instit utional leadership and  the  regular delivery of value to both parties through a  variety of research, development ,   and commercialization collaborations. After ConAgra formally declared  intentions to develop a physical presence at  NIC , UNL and ConAgra leaders hip asked  hat if the entire  Department of FS&T and the FPC moved to  N IC   and had brand new facilities and expansive physical  collaborative space with other food industry stakeholders?
p2881
aVAs a result of this  visioning, FS&T and the  FPC will open their door s at NIC this July with   brand new lab oratory ,  teaching ,   and office space, along with three new pilot plant facilities, and some new collaborative neighbors from  the private sector, including ConAgra Foods.   With the new location and greatly expanded pilot f acilities, UNL  and ConAgra have launched a new industry consortium focused on disruptive technologies for food sanitation  manufacturing with  several   charter companies   . T ogether with  UNL    College of Engineering,  the  University of California, Davis, the  Georgia Institute of Technology ,   and ConAgra Foods , this consortium is   hosting a workshop at UNL this month  with attendance expected from most global food m anufacturers foc used on   developing a national manufacturing  hub of excellence, tentatively called the  Food Factory of the Future .

aV  14     III.    GROWTH   AND  IMPROVEMENT PLAN   (Word Count: 1382/2000)     The self - study process, stakeholder surveys, and prior feedback helped the team refine our improvement goals to  three key areas. The observations from the self - study process and suggested improvement goals are being shared  with the University of Nebraska - L  consideration  over the next  two to three   years. We intend to pursue improvement in the following three areas:     1.   Improve Economic Engagement Communication  Outreach, Education ,   and Awareness     A continued area  of improvement opportunity is in our economic engagement communication efforts. Both  internal and external stakeholders view communications as an area of high importance ,   and our performance fell  between fair  to   good.  It is important to note that for our i mprovement purposes, news releases and other public  media were a relatively small issue compared with internal and external education and awareness activity. The   ent will support  our related goals and objectives, consistent and strategic education and awareness outreach to faculty, companies,  economic development professionals, government officials ,   and others involved with regional economic  development and competi tiveness will yield far greater returns.  We intend to improve in this area through the  following key objectives:     Development of an integrated communication plan :   G reat gains will be realized through the coordination  and collaboration of economic engagement messaging. Through the self - study process, we learned that capturing  and leveraging success stories across our entire institution is viewed as a favorable way to  promote our economic  engagement efforts. Through outreach to existing employees     such as technology managers, PIs, and center  directors     we intend to generate success stories more often and sooner. Well established communication channels  already exist, r eaching our internal and external stakeholders. This communication plan will outline strategies to  capitalize on these channels.
p2889
aVImprovement of internal awareness of resources and policies regarding economic development :   W e were encouraged by the desire  employees have to learn more about and engage in economic development. To  support this desire, we will collaborate with the Office of Sponsored Programs   (OSP)   to raise awareness of  economic development policies and opportunities. Faculty and researchers ar e already attuned to messaging   from  OSP, making this an excellent vehicle to carry the messaging. Further engagement training will take place on a  local level with department chairs and directors, led by the Industry Relations team.     Reporting our impact o n our local and regional economic ecosystem :   A  value proposition and economic impact will add another tool to help attract external partners.
p2890
aVContinued solicitation of feedback through surveys and focus groups :   T o determine if   our  communication improvements are successful and to engage in a deeper dialogue regarding the survey results, we  intend to more regularly solicit feedback from students, internal stakeholders, and external stakeholders. The  communication of this feedback   through webinars and/or face - to - face meetings has also been received favorably.     Engagement and education of external stakeholders on partnering with UNL :   O n an ongoing basis,  we intend to expand the ways in which we engage and educate external stakeholde rs, such as our economic  development colleagues with the Nebraska Department of Economic Development or potential industry partners.  Efforts to keep these stakeholders abreast to new opportunities with UNL, ways to engage, and policies will help  facilitate   interactions with a variety of entry points into the University.

aV  15     2.   Foster an Entrepreneurial Climate  Educate, Encourage ,   and Empower     Through the student survey, it was underscored that students feel unprepared by their post - secondary education to   ,   and 38.3%   innovative skills learned through entrepr eneurial education can benefit a wide variety of post - collegiate activities.  Students indicated that experiential learning opportunities were beneficial to their learning. 72.4% of students  indicated speakers with business experience were very helpful or h elpful in learning about starting companies ,   and 72.3% of students indicated projects with sponsor companies aided their learning very favorably or favorably.  A second survey question examined the helpfulness of teaching methods in learning how to handle b usiness  situations ;   76.5% of students found speakers with business experience to be very helpful or helpful ,   and 74.3%  found projects with sponsor companies to be helpful or very helpful. With this feedback in mind, we plan to learn  from existing successes   and look for ways to replicate these successes across disciplines.

aVReview of peer and exemplar entrepreneurial programs to determine best practice s:   A   period of  discovery will be beneficial to inform our decision making process and understand the approa ches to infusing  entrepreneurial skill development in a variety of ways.     Analysis of successful, existing UNL programs for replicability across disciplines :   A s outlined in  the accomplishments section, programs such as the Raikes School Design Studio alrea dy incorporate  many  of the  elements students deemed helpful to their learning. We plan to analyze this success and look for ways this can be  replicated across other disciplines.     Exploration of curricular and co - curricular entrepreneurship opportunities :   T he student survey  responses were representative of our diverse disciplinary offerings. As we look to grow in this area, we intend to  explore current initiatives,   as well as  faculty affinity for and opportunity to include mentoring, industry speakers,  and c apstone projects through curricular and co - curricular offerings.     3.   Build Capacity for Innovation  Fair   and Fast     To continue fostering economic growth and innovation, we plan to build capacity in parallel with our  improvements in communication. In general, i t is our goal to make it easy for external partners to interact with the  University. Two areas of improvement needed are in the processes for commercializing technology and bringing  diverse groups together for a shared purpose. Increasing the internal know ledge of economic development  programs and resources will also have downstream benefits.
p2893
aVImprovement licensing, technology transfer, and research agreement processes :   W e have already  observed be nefits from hiring a contracts specialist dedicated to indus try   agreements and negotiations  to support  NUtech Ventures , Industry Relations ,   and N ebraska Innovation Campus  from within the Office of Sponsored  Programs   (OSP) .   Continued tracking in this area will be helpful to ensure this resource is being used. We have  also observed significant process improvements when the Industry Relations, NUtech Ventu res, and/or the OSP  industry contracts specialist   are involved in agreem ents /negotiations   from the ground floor.
p2894
aVConnection of internal and external interests for collaborative partnerships :   A   prime example of an  industry partner engaging in multiple areas of the University is ConAgra Foods. In our accomplishments section,  w e discussed their involvement on Nebraska Innovation Campus with the Food Science and Technology  department. ConAgra has also established a robust internship pipeline with our finance and accounting students  
p2895
aV  16     and engages researchers   across several departmen ts and colleges .  UNL has other examples of such elevated  partnerships, and w e inte nd to seek ways to replicate these   success es   and engage partners in  other industry sectors  in  a  similar fashion.   Tracking the  various types of active and historic collaborati ons and transactions is currently  undertaken by the various individual academic and administrative units involved . Aggregating this information  in  a common repository  will improve coordination and relationship - management.     An easing of the ability for exte rnal partners to interact with UNL :   T hree of th  economic groups are co - located in an office suite at our new public - private   research  campus ,   Nebraska Innovation  Campus. This proximity has increased collaboration between Industry Relations, NUtech Ventures, and the  Nebraska Innovation Campus administrative team. External stakeholders have responded favorably as these  service areas are easier to   find   and are increasingly coordinated on transactions and deals that involve more than  one of those groups . Continu ous   efforts to build synergies will be  ongoing  and will be  a  particular  focus for the  next year.     Expansion of resources for faculty and aca demic unit business coordinators :   I n the self - study  survey, it was underscored that faculty would like to learn more about economic  engagement and  development  opportunities and gain understanding of policy changes. On an ongoing basis, we will plan opportu nities for  faculty to learn about federal and state programs, tailor opportunity guides to  principal investigator   and faculty  audiences, and host learning sessions. Academic unit business coordinators will be key to supporting faculty and  researchers.

aV INTRODUCTION     UNM is committed to building a Rainforest for Economic Development in the  d esert of Albuquerque,  New Mexico. The Rainforest concept originated with Victor Hwang and Gregg Horowitt, experienced  entrepreneurs and venture capitalists who co -  Secret to Building the Next Silicon Val  The authors emphasize that   the goal is not to script the  creation and evolution of new ideas, but rather to create a rich and flexible environment that allows  innovation to be born and thrive in unpredictable ways. This concept is founded on principl es of trust,  collaboration, and experimentation.  UNM, the City of Albuquerque and other community leaders  are  creating   an innovation district  in Albuquerque   research, strong entrepreneurial assets, an d thriving creative community  our Rainforest in the De sert.  This narrative i nterprets innovation and economic   prosperity based on the Rainforest concept:     Innovation   Real world i nnovation is a complex endeavor  based on the premise that human relationships  are central to  the process .   Innovation is bringing together the right people with ideas, talents/special skills, and capital  at the right time and in the right way to   create something  new that is  allow ed   to evolve   organically.  F ostering  these  human relati onships  requires   eliminating geographic, social, cultural, language and trust  barriers that prevent successf ul connections, collaborations  and creations .   This is the Rainforest way for  developing highly productive , systemic   innovation ecosystems.     Economic  Prosperity   R elationships developed on an individual level  contribute   to  the economic prosperity of   community .  For  UNM , it means having a direct impact on economic growth at local, regional, nat ional  and international levels by  changing New   from dependency on  federal spending to  create jo bs to an innovation economy   whose  jobs  are  created from private sector investment in small to  mid - sized high - technology companies.    Rainforest in the Desert program is about empowering  people to create innovation and economic value that will sustain our innovation ecosystem.

aV  PROCESS EXPERIENCE     In 2012,  UNM  envision ed   a desired future state ( UNM  2020 1 )  for the university by develo ping a  strategic  plan .     An open and inclusive process engaging more than  1,000   stakeholders in live and virtual sessions  produced  seven goals   for UNM  2020.  One of the  seven   goals  for UNM  is to advance and accelerate  economic development. An important part of implementing this go al is to participate in the 2015 APLU  IEP designation program.

The core team implementing this process is the UNM economic  developm ent team at STC.UNM (STC),   Lisa Kuuttila, CEO and Chief Economic Development Officer,  Eri Hoshi, Economic Development Manager and Cara Michaliszyn, New Ventures Development  Manager.  The team has held over 500 community meetings over the past year t o engage various  stakeholders.
p2917
aVAPLU CICEP   2015  Innovation and Economic Prosperity  Universities   UNM Designation Application   Page  4   of  24     In 2013,  UNM decided to conduct a baseline internal and external stakeholder survey and to do an  updated impact study of university based start - up companies.
p2918
aV For the external survey, STC adapted the survey  for  an online p ortal and modified the questions to be  specific to UNM.  The modified format aligned with the UNM 2020 strategic plan.  The survey was   Economic Development Forum (EDF).  The  EDF  was   established  t o  interact  and connect  with th e business community and currently consists of over  160   members from the  New Mexico business community.  The  EDF meets monthly to share information on economic  development activities in the community.  The second annual survey was distributed to the EDF and   more  widely to the business community.
p2919
aVFor the internal survey, the tool as provided by the IEP program was modified based on comments from  the UNM Economic Development Council (UNM EDC) before deployment. The UNM EDC was  established by the  UNM  Presiden t to serve as a coordinating entity and think tank for the internal UNM  community on economic development matters. EDC membership consists of deans of colleges, center  directors and representatives from selected administrative units  at UNM and its branch c ampuses  focused  on increasing the economic impact of UNM on New Mexico.  The baseline internal survey and the second  annual internal survey were distributed via email thro ugh the all faculty list serv.
p2920
aV As mentioned above, we conducted the baseline intern al and external surveys to clearly identify our  strengths and areas  for   improvement.  One year later in June 2014 and September 2014,  both surveys  were distributed to analyze any differences.    We plan to distribute for   a third time in June 2015 and  Septemb er 2015.
p2921
aVWe summarized the data from the  surveys and   distributed widely via our E conomic Development  Newsletter 2   (partial summary available in Appendix 1) . Interestingly, the   self - study  results are somewhat  different from the external community survey.   The external community rated UNM higher   than the  faculty did   for the following measures: Create a Supportive Culture; Develop an Innovation Economy   (especially higher) ; Promote Openness, Accessibility, and Responsiveness; and Communicate  Contrib utions, Suc cesses, Achievements that Benefit Region .    These results have created the basis for
p2922
aV Additionally, i n 1945, UNM established the Bureau of Business and Economic Research (BBER) in order  for UNM to define for itself a significant role in providing community services and leadership. BBER  was created at UNM as a way to focus university resources in an effort   to foster the economic  development of New Mexico.  Over time, BBER has conducted many studies to help New Mexicans  better understand the state's economy and the demographic characteristics of the population.  STC   also  assisted the UNM  BBER   in May 2014 to c onduct a study of the economic impact of start - up companies  using  UNM  technologies on the economy of New Mexico. BBER conducted si milar analyses in 2004 and  2011. 3   This analysis updated   the previous studies and emphasizes the impact of high - tech start - up  c ompanies that have had a relationship with  STC   from 2004 to  June 2014.

This engagement includes alliances with other educational institutions, businesses,  foundations, and governments to develop global economic well - being.     The Economic Engagement Enterprise  for UNM is organized under the  management of STC , UNM 's technology - transfer and economic - development  organization .   This aligns economic  development with UNM's ongoing  investment in intellectual property,  technology commercialization, and the  creation   of start - up companies.  STC   is  structured as a business no n - profit with a  governing board of 60% representation  from the community and 40%  representation from UNM, foster ing   a  positive interaction between the  university and its community and  communicat ing   a shared vision for  economic engagement to all stakeholder s.  The board guides S TC in its mission to  support   UNM   and its partners as the  source for innovation management and  commercial development in six strategic  areas of service to UNM   (pictured right) .     The  UNM  Office of the Vice President for Research   (OVPR)   coordinates research activities including  sponsored research, industry partnerships, interdisciplinary centers and institutes.  The UNM Health  Sciences Center   (HSC)   Research Enterprise is  developing  cutting - edge programs in telehealth, such as  Project ECH O,  which   provides real - time video access for clinicians in remote areas of New Mexico,  linking them with consulting University physicians, researchers and healthcare experts.   Biomedical Research Education Programs are example s   of how research dollars   directly affect students.  The programs   are designed to train the next generation of scientists with the goal of identifying, retaining     (CTSC) , established   in 2010, continues to build consortiums and   open doors for collaborations,  developing  partnerships  among HSC departments and main campus  dep artments , and with regional and  national entities dedicated to conducting biomedical research.     Additionally, UNM h as made a commitment to support economic development activities in the City of  Albuquerque and throughout Bernalillo County. One way it is accomplishing this is through new  partnerships aimed at building a district for research and innovation  in downtown A lbuquerque   called  Innovate ABQ 4 . UNM has a proven track record of commercializing research activities, but by focusing  its energy in partnership with the City, County and other organizations, the University  believes it can  help  ignite a more vigorous local   and regional economy. Such a district will help retain students and  researchers in Albuquerque well beyond their tenure at UNM and facilitate the creation of new businesses  and jobs. In turn, a flourishing city with improved innovation - based employment op portunities will help  attract a new generation of high - caliber students, faculty, researchers, innovators, and entrepreneurs.

aVbecause of its correlation wi th student success. Students need  academic and work opportunities and   UNM  graduates need to have more high - paying jobs as an incentive to stay in New Mexico .  A commitment to  economic development is also consistent with UNM's mission as a research universit y with an associated  teaching hospital. UNM is not fully capitalizing on technology commercialization that could bring  economic benefit to the state and region. Better leveraging of the resources both within UNM and its  community will help raise New Mexico 's economic profile. Research universities with associated medical  schools and teaching hospitals are considered "anchor institutions" for building innovation in their  regional economies. UNM is committed to building on these assets to support economic dev elopment.     Additionally, UNM is uniquely situated between two national labs and an air force research lab. By  creating stronger ties to these national research institutions, UNM can accelerate collaborative research  and more effectively leverage technology - transfer opportunities for our state.    This is  an  ongoing effort to  create stronger ties between the labs.

SNL  and  UNM have enjoyed a close relationship for many years in the areas of research, education , and  technology development and deployment.  Starting in 1959, the Technology Development Program  between the UNM School of Engineering and Sandia helped many engineers at  SNL   earn their graduate  degrees.  Today, UNM students enhance their research and wo rk experience at S NL .  In the 1990s UNM  and S NL    - Engineered Materials and the Advanced Materials Laboratory, which all foster research collaborations  and technology tran sfer and commercialization among UNM, S NL , and private companies.  Many SNL  scientists serve in some teaching capacity at UNM and more than 1,800 UNM alumni are currently  working at SNL.     In 2011 UNM and SNL signed a new Memorandum of Understanding,  updating the AML MOU that  significantly strengthens collaborative research and development between the two institutions, expanding  the opportunities for students to participate in cutting - edge research and preparing them for a global job  market through int ernships, graduate research  funding and job opportunities.  Other goals  included developing new areas of expertise and  technologies in quantum information, energy  technologies and nanoparticle - based drug delivery  and attracting talented students and nation ally  prominent faculty and researchers.     In 2014, UNM and S NL   signed an Inter - Institutional Visitors Agreement allowing closer  research collaborations between researchers at  UNM and SNL, allo wing UNM researchers easier  access SNL facilities.

aV   At about the same time, President Frank asked STC to take on the role of representing UNM in economic  develop ment initiatives. Numerous meetings with community members were held to discuss the Perkins  & Will recommendations and much feedback was incorporated into the plan as it continued to be refined  over the summer.     Perkins + Will identified the Central/Broadw ay site as the ideal headquarters site for  Innovate ABQ.     By July 2013, STC actively pursued funding sources for Innovate ABQ and our vision was beginning to  broaden, based on  feedback from the community.   STC   submitted a proposal to the Department of  Comme  Central/Broadway property.     The City was our clear partner in the project.    In the  fall   of 2013  $2 million funding for Innovate ABQ was approved by voters, the  Nus enda   Credit Union pledged $3  million to the project, and the EDA grant was approved for $1.5 million.     Other donors expressed interest  as well.   The   UNM Regents voted unanimously to move forward with the purchase of the  C entral/Broadway site for an innovati on center in downtown Albuquerque, with widespread testimonial  support from representatives of the campus community   including from the EDC .    The Bernalillo County  has now earmark ed $1 Million, Innovate ABQ has  been formed as a UNM - owned corporation,  and  th e  property was purchased. The Development Framework for Innovate ABQ has been completed and a  Request for Proposal has been distrib uted to developers as of April 2015.     Innovate ABQ Partnership is just the beginning, but a result as driving what the commun ity economic  growth  priorities   are.  Th is project was incubated by  UNM   through   soliciting feedback and many  meetings with   the community, neighborhoods, UN M faculty and staff, students, and statewide   organizations.   The implementation of Innovate ABQ is a goal in itself.   This framework demonstrates  connections across Talent, Innovation and Place Development.

Alpine Biosciences was created to   rugs directly to cancer  cells.  The technology holds great promise for revolutionizing the way cancer is diagnosed and treated.   STC start - up nanoMR was acquired by London - based biotech company DNAe (DNA Electronics Ltd).   nanoMR was created to develop a t echnology that can rapidly diagnose infections in blood.  The biotech  companies will continue to develop the technologies, with continued licensing, royalties, sponsored - research dollars coming to UNM and its inventors.

aV STC shares its knowledge with peo ple by promoting UNM technologies and providing an extensive  outreach program of events.  STC hosts free seminars for the UNM and non - UNM communities.   Attendees learn about protecting their IP, forming start - up companies and how to find VC funding, and  of ten connect with other inventors, entrepreneurs and investors.  STC invites community entrepreneurs  and investors to regular technology presentations and provides other opportunities for them to connect  through technology showcases and one - on - one introduct ions.  STC regularly meets with outside  organizations such as New Mexico's three national labs to sponsor joint technologies and research and  share our resources.  STC connects with UNM inventors by providing gap funding for their early stage  technologies  and by hosting an annual innovation awards  reception that   recognizes their issued patents,  confirming the quality of their technologies.     The STC  Board of Directors created  the STC Innovation Fellow   award in 2010 to annually honor a UNM  inventor whose body of technologies has generated significant commercialization activities. Based on  achievements in new technologies disclosed, patents received, license and option agreements entered into,  new compan ies started and income generate d from these technologies, the   Innovation Fellow Selection  Committee evaluates and selects an Innovation Fellow.   The social and economic impact of the awardee's  technologies in the marketplace is important. New technologies r esulting in substantial benefit to the  public may have the most valuable impact on society. The Innovation Fellow award is recognition of that  impact.  The   Innovation Fellows raise the visibility of inventors both inside and outside the UNM  community, and a ct as a network of mentors and collaborators who will drive future inventive endeavors  for UNM and STC.  UNM now has seven Innovation Fellows.     All the efforts of growing an Innovation Economy are vital to economic prosperity and the goal is to  continue an d expand all these programs.

This summit  has  set very high expectations and  UNM has been   working to develop realistic goals based on the  signification amount of   interest   received   as a result of this meeting. Over the past two years, UNM has developed a strategic plan to move  economic development forward.  The various meetings, the self - study  and stakeholder engagement has  identified three areas of growth to work on:
p2981
aVGoal 1  -   Creating a hub for innovation to facilitate collaborations and enhance public/private  partnerships     Albuquerque and New Mexico have many of the ingredients to build a  thriving innovation ecosystem;
p2982
aVsuch as  the need for more entrepreneurs to move intellectual property forward and historically addressing the  underrepresentation of   venture - capital investments per capita here in New Mexico.
p2983
aV Through the self - study process and many stakeholder community meetings, UNM has identified areas of  for growth that will help overcome the need for vibrant UNM and New Mexico Economy.   The EDF   and  EDC have identified that UNM has   many of the resources of a vibrant economy, but in order to have a  vibrant   economy, UNM and the community   need to bring all these ingredients together to connect the  dots and break down the isolations.
p2984
aVUNM has made a  commitment to support economic development activities in the City of Albuquerque  and throughout Bernalillo County. One way it is accomplishing this is through new partnerships aimed at  building a district for research and innovation within the city. UNM ha s a proven track record of  commercializing research activities, but by focusing its energy in partnership with the City, County and  other organizations, the University believes it can ignite a more vigorous local and regional economy.  Such a district will  help retain students and researchers in Albuquerque well beyond their tenure at UNM  and facilitate the creation of new businesses and jobs. In turn, a flourishing city with improved  innovation - based employment opportunities will help attract a new generati on of high - caliber students,  faculty, researchers, innovators, and entrepreneurs.     Innovate ABQ is a core site that is a catalyst for this district. Founded on a seven - acre former First Baptist  Church site purchased by UNM in 2014, it is envisioned as a hu b for research and innovation activities  and programs throughout the region. Its plan, illustrated in this document, is aimed at maximizing the  opportunity to accommodate development for this purpose while also creating a place that is highly  integrated wi
p2985
aVThe plan for Innovate ABQ  a Development Framework 11    is aimed at promoting flexibility to the  greatest extent possible. Rather than prescribe a specific, absolute end result, it p uts into place a vision  and clear, flexible framework within which opportunities for both innovation and development can  emerge organically, respond to change over time, capitalize on the resources of the region, and ultimately  become a place where innovat ion will thrive.

aVAdditionally,  STC   would like to expand the university incubator , Cecchi Venture Lab,   to serves as a  catalyst of the new start - up companies off of university technology which support economic growth.   STC   would like to have more office space and serve more clients   (most likely as a part of Innovate ABQ) .   We currently have 4 offices (all o ccupied) and 12 virtual tenants.  As part of this, the plan is for the  incubator  to   to provide faculty and student resources to assist in the development and success  of local entrepreneurs  and small businesses.    This is a   natural collaboration that is not currently taking place.

aVGoal 2  -   Increase licensing revenue, commercialization activities, and industry - sponsored research
p2990
aV technology commercialization worldwide.  STC has an array of technologies currently available for  licensing. Technologies include catalysts, diagnostics, drug delivery, fuel cells, lasers, lithography ,  materials, medical imaging, nanoparticles, optoelectronics, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, sensors,  software, and therapeutics. These technologies are in industries with above average salaries, making STC  a strong generator of innovative research, new  companies, and good jobs for UNM graduates and an  expanding, sustainable New Mexico economy (UNM  BBER   2014).  Under the leadership of CEO Lisa  Kuuttila, STC is growing its program using the Rainforest model to develop an innovation economy in  New Mexico.     One way to do this is by e xpand ing the STC   Technology Social events that   were  piloted in  fall   2014.   These events feature new technologies presented by UNM faculty and UNM technology - based start - up  company presentations to connect with industry and advance   commercialization.  To further support this,  STC will begin to distribute    out - of - state  entrepreneurs and investors.  It would be a short message that would showcase two start - up companies to  displ ay what they have accomplished and what they might need.   It would be a concise message to   nodes and bring people to New Mexico to help move ideas and c ompanies forward.
p2991
aV The Biodesign 12   initiative is important part of increasing potential commercialization activities. It brings  together biomedical researchers, clinicians, engineers, and other specialists to develop commercially  viable medical devices that will greatly impact the everyday   lives of people living with diseases and  health conditions.    Currently, there are some strong silos between the UNM Health Sciences Center and  UNM Main Campus and this will bring together researchers from all parts of campus.   During facilitated  brainstor ming sessions, participants devise solutions to existing barriers and problems in current clinical   Science Center (CTSC) pilot funding, which provides access    translational technologies and clinical facilities.     UNM would like to e stablish a model to i ncrease Industry - Sponsored Research   agreements.  This would  be through the implementation and operation of a n   intellectual property research program.   STC would  provide marketing and outreach to potential candidates for this new program. Basically, UNM and STC

aV Goal 3  -   Enhance a culture of entrepreneurship and innovation among students and faculty with  the aim of f ostering economic development in New Mexico     Innovation starts with education.    The UNM Economic Development Forum has expressed its concerns     On the other hand, several members of the  busines s community have expressed that they cannot find talent locally in New Mexico and reach out to  Boston or San Francisco for employees.  UNM is committed to making an effort to change these  conflicting perspectives.  Through the Office of Provost, the UNM In novation Academy 13   is being  pla nned and expected to launch in f all 2015.  The  Innovation Academy   wil l   develop student ideas,  concepts, products and entrepreneurs.   I nnovation Academy courses develop critical thinking and  problem - solving skills alongside  subject - based knowledge and technical skills. Students learn through  experience, in interdisciplinary contexts, working on real problems and trying out new ideas. Sometimes  they will fail when working on actual problems without known solutions, but failure   can foster critical  thinking, patience, and personal resilience.     Innovation Ac ademy pilot courses will   assess whether students increase their skills by taking the course.  The Innovation Academy faculty partners with assessment specialists to develop inst ruments to assess   the entrepreneurs of the future, the Innovation Academy will also provide a location where UNM faculty   learn how to be better teac hers and pilot new pedagogies that offer a robust means of incorporating real - world problems into the classroom.   Part of the Academy would include an Innovation Scholars Program  which would require minimum participation in clubs, lectures, and career servi ces along with the  oppo rtunity for a Major,  Minor  and Graduate Studies   Innovation is a priority for  employers today. Nearly all employers surveyed (95 percent) say they give hiring preference to college  graduates with skills that will enab le them to contribute to innovation in the workplace. More than nine in    (Source: Hart Research  Association 2013) .     Entrepreneurial Student Inventor Pitches will be expanded   as a part of the Innovation Academy.  The goal  is for students to realize the impact  not only   a start - up business can have on society and the economy, but  also themselves as individuals.
p2995
aVIn addition to support the culture of the entrepreneurship and fos ter economic development, UNM will  launch a  Self - Employment Fair  that  will be a campus - wide event to provide information to those  considering entrepreneurship as a career option.   UNM   will include representatives from the business  community to answer questions and provide self - employment and entrepreneurial information and  resources. This is the perfect opportunity for those who are having difficulties finding a job or for students  get ting ready to graduate who would like to start a business.     UNM must also provide support to UNM faculty interested   in becoming entrepreneurs. STC   has the goal  to launch a monthly UNM Faculty Entrepreneurs Network with the goal of a dvancing more ventures a t  UNM.    It will give faculty the opportunity to network with peers and educate new UNM faculty  entrepreneurs on commercialization prospects for their technologies.

aV Mission:  To foster a Rainforest in the Desert, STC.UNM nurtures innovat ion and economic development    for the UNM community.   Vision:  As a keystone organization, STC.UNM will play a vital role in the  New Mexico innovation ecosystem. We will be a boundary spanning canopy fo r technology  commercialization  worldwide.     In 500 words or less, explain your business model and the way in   which your model enables activity  across an entire ecosystem.   Our conventional business model is described as a 501(c)(3) non - profit corporation with an independent  board of directors formed by the Regents of the University of New Mexico (UNM) in order to   more  efficiently transfer technology developed at the University to the marketplace through the creation of  start - up companies and the negotiation of license agreements with start - ups and established companies.   Further elaboration would also say we are a   trifecta of science, business and the law, in the sense that   psychology into the mix, since understanding human behavior is also critical to our process.
p3007
aVWhat   best describes our business model is the flow - form model of transactions formulated by Karen  Tesson because it captures the complex system of interactions that is the essence of STC activity.   We are  a fluid - based social networking model rather than node - based network.   For us, ideas, talent and capital  
p3008
aVAPLU CICEP   2015  Innovation and Economic Prosperity  Universities   UNM Designation Application   Page  22   of  24     are continually circulating throughout our system, colliding into collaborations that spread out further and  loop around to meet the outcomes of other colliding collaborations.
p3009
aVWe have evidence that our   fluid system is generating activity across our ecosystem. Many of the  entrepreneurs we work with are now not only serial entrepreneurs but cross - over entrepreneurs, heading  up not only multiple start - ups but crossing over to commercialize technologies in  other disciplines.   Our  connections with inventors are yielding more collaborations as well. Because of our inclusive approach to  scheduling and conducting meetings with inventors where we try to match up complementary  technologies, we have increased our  collaborations between life and physical sciences.  A recent complex  collaboration that comes to mind involves  technology that has been developed over the last four years by  a large collaborative team of researchers at UNM and Sandia, led by Dr. Jeff Brink er from the Dept. of  Chemical & Nuclear Engineering and a Sandia Fellow, and Dr. Cheryl Willman, CEO of the UNM  Cancer Center.     This joint technology  promises to transform the way cancer is treated has moved closer  to reality with an option license agreem ent with the biotech investment firm Alpine Biosciences.    We  have crossed over international boundaries as well with a burgeoning economic development initiatives  with industry and universities in Japan, Columbia, Spain, Mexico and Israel.  Flowing back fr om this  effort is our international student exchanges with Poland and foreign exchange students at UNM, one of  whom, now on staff, heads up our international efforts.    The fastest growing arteries in our fluid  networking model are the two advisory groups   formed this year to partner with us in our efforts to build  an innovation economy.  The stakeholders in the external group include more than 80 community and   embers   stakeholders in the internal group include more than 30 UNM leaders and entrepreneurial faculty who are  helping us to focus UNM on its role in the i nnovation economy.

aVHow does your business/organization connect people, who are otherwise disconnected, in  meaningful, productive ways?   As a keystone organization, we are constantly bringing disparate people together who each hold a piece of  the innovatio n puzzle.  We strive to have as little hierarchy as possible and avoid top - down inefficiencies.   We treat all of our customers equitably whether they are first time inventors, successful serial  entrepreneurs, or established investors through consistent, fa ir contracts and negotiations that apply to  everyone.  We break down those social barriers by remaining neutral when conflicts arise among the  players and advocating when we can for those that need our support.  We have a diverse, entrepreneurial  board (40 % university researchers and administrators and 60% business people) who develop policies that  support the Bayh -  core values several years ago that are the underpinning of ever y connection that we make with people:

aVThe core values guide us in al l aspects of our work, including our interactions with all of our  constituencies and our decision - making processes.     We share our knowledge with people by promoting our technologies and providing an extensive outreach  program of events.  We market our tech nologies on Flintbox, an online platform that connects  collaborative technology communities for commercialization opportunities, representing over 14,000  registered users and 400 different organizations across six continents.  We have a customized database   that manages our technologies and is accessible to our universities inventors so that they can see how we  are commercializing their technologies.  We host free seminars for the UNM and non - UNM communities  where attendees learn about protecting their IP, s tart - up companies and how to find VC funding and  where connections often take place among inventor, entrepreneur and investor.  We invite community  entrepreneurs and investors to regular technology presentations and provide other opportunities for them  to  connect through technology showcases and one - on - one introductions.  We regularly meet with outside  organizations such as New Mexico's three national labs to sponsor joint technologies and research and  share our resources.  We connect with our inventors by  providing gap funding for their early stage  technologies and recognition of issued patents, confirming the quality of their technologies, by hosting an  innovation awards reception.     How does your business/organization create a platform that lowers the cost   of doing business across  an entire system?     We offer low - cost intellectual property and simple contracts with standardized terms, reducing legal and  accounting costs.  Brick and mortar aren't requirements for doing business with us.  We offer easy access  to our business incubator and virtual tenancy   for those start - ups who want it.  We do appropriate  matchmaking between our CEOs and start - ups.  We are proactive problem solvers, constantly looking for  new solutions and incorporating innovation into our own operations.   Though STC is a small technolog y  transfer program in comparison to larger and older university programs, we have been identified by  Wellspring Worldwide, makers of the Sophia IP management system, the customized database that we  use to manage our IP and commercialization information, as   power users.  We use the system at a higher  level than others which increases our efficiency and reduces the cost of training and support.   Another  big reform instituted last year has literally "paid off" for the organization.  We have developed a proces s  to monitor our IP attorney costs, which has allowed us to reduce costs and recover more IP legal expenses  from our licensees.  Our multiple review process for agreements and IP prosecution management by  experienced staff with extensive technology transfe r knowledge who have established good relationships  with patent counsel and companies and inventors has save us money and generate money for our  inventors, university and start - ups.   Our long - term goal of creating an innovation district in Albuquerque  and   New Mexico, which is in the initial planning stage, will lower the cost of doing business on a larger  scale by creating a bigger one - stop - shop approach to economic development that keeps customers and  partners in larger circulating loops.
p3014
aV How does our  business/organization foster trust (both internally and externally) in your  community, industry, or society?     We have an open door attitude about meeting people, whether they are potential clients and customers or  are individuals with other objectives or u ndefined goals.  We establish a relationship with them, listen to  their needs and concerns and then hook them up with the right contact or resources regardless of whether  it will benefit us now with deals and revenue or benefit us later in a way that is un foreseen. For example,  we have been working closely with a small start - up company considering a move to Albuquerque.  They  
p3015
aVAPLU CICEP   2015  Innovation and Economic Prosperity  Universities   UNM Designation Application   Page  24   of  24     have no license with STC or a direct connection to UNM. However, we arranged introductions, meetings  and tours in order to introduce  the company to the community. They now have a strong connection and   many industries we work with because we have a reputation for being compromisers where pos sible to  further larger goals and for being facilitators who really do help rather than hinder the process of  commercialization.  Our work is transparent and this especially promotes trust among our clients and  customers.  Our inventors trust us because th ey have access to the work we do for them through our  Sophia database.  We publish our metrics on our website and seek media coverage to explain who we are,   sactions.   Companies trust that we have integrity and competence because we follow through on all the details of  negotiations and contracts.   We strive to understand the people we work with inside and outside of our  organization.  This effort addresses th e psychological aspect of our activities, mentioned in the business  model description .     How does your business/organization demonstrate social responsibility or sustainable, systemic  impact?     As the tech transfer and economic development arm of the  University of New Mexico, we are committed  to creating knowledge worker jobs for our students and workers throughout our community by creating  and attracting companies to our community.  We want to diversify the economic in New Mexico to be  less dependent  on government by spurring private sector growth, a more sustainable way to increase  economic development.  Our systemic impact is ongoing through the many supportive programs and  activities we provide to inventors, students, entrepreneurs, investors, compa nies, other universities, and  governments locally, nationally, and internationally.  We are creating the next generation of  entrepreneurs, inventors and investors.  The technologies we commercialize not only have economic  impact but social impact, curing d isease, improving everyday living and providing high - tech products and  processes for many industry and manufacturing sectors from high - speed cytometers to smart grid  technology.  Our public policy forums and initiatives such as patent reform, creating inno vation  economies as the new paradigm for economic development, and teaching best practices in technology  transfer to the many educational institutions in the U.S. and overseas who want to create programs are  things we do because we believe we have a so cial   responsibility to do so.

p3021
aV  Economic Prosperity   is also regarded more broadly than traditional interpretations of  prosperity often captured in economic measures such as GDP.  The University has a  perspective similar to the position articulated by Robert Kennedy in 1968,   when he lamented  that GDP  "measures everything . . . except that which makes life worthwhile."    Legatum Institute . This view em braces a broader set of measures that include, but are not  limited to, economic fundamentals:

aVacademic programs and public service offerings make Pitt more than just an economic engine. This     dimensions outlined above.
p3023
aV3   B.   Process experience     The University of Pittsburgh has long been engaged in studying and documenting its impacts on the  local economy and its engagement in the community. The first University economic impact report was  a 1972   study,  The Impact of the University of Pittsburgh on the Local Economy , based on a new  methodology that had recently been produced (Caffrey and Isaacs, 1971).     Over the next decades, the University of Pittsburgh continued to produce a series of reports on   the   an d community.  Periodically the U niversity has contracted with external consultants to provide a more  thorough evaluation of its impacts.   In 2013, the University contracted with TrippUmbach to perform a  comprehensive evaluat ion and document its findings.  In parallel, the U niversity became part of the  2013/2014 cohort for CICEP designation.
p3024
aV Performing two related, but separate, economic im pact evaluations concurrently presented both  opportunities and challenges. In order to coordinate efforts and mitigate confusion, a 3 - person Project  Committee was formed to manage the third party consultant and coordinate all related activities:
p3025
aVDavid Ruppersberger     Director of Joint Economic Development Initiatives     Both evaluations utilized the resources of a 17 - member PITT Econo mic Impact Team to plan, execute,  and review findings .  The Impact Team consists of senior staff from research, finance, institutional  advancement, government relations, athletics, academic affairs, and economic development. All five  Pitt campuses are repre sented on the team.     With input from TrippUmbach, the Project Committee developed a plan and timeline to complete the  evaluations within reporting/application deadlines (see Figure 1 below).
p3026
aV   The major activities undertaken in the parallel processes are   summarized below:     Economic Impact Report (EIR) Activities
p3027
aVThe Pitt team implemented the Institutional Self - Study Survey ins trument in Qualtrics.
p3028
aVThe Pitt team engaged key department heads and solicited their support in surveying  personnel within their departments.  In many cases, an agreement was made to share  department - specific survey data with the department coordinator and   his/her team.  An   - Study Survey to accommodate the  Corporate Relations Committee.
p3029
aVA total of 550 survey requests were distributed to internal constituents (including a lar ge number of  past and presen t inventors).  The overall response rate was 49.1% .  The survey was augmented by  one - on - one surveys by the TrippUmbach team.   Figure 2 below summarizes response data.
p3030
aV   External Stakeholder Input Survey     After considering a number of options   for soliciting External Stakeholder input , the Pitt team decided  to target key stakeholders across the spectrum of organizational perspectives prescribed in the survey  instrument. The Stakeholder Input Survey was implemented in Qualtrics. Questions were c ustomized  for Government and IEE Stakeholders (a constituency that was added to the list of targets) .   A total of  198 very targeted survey requests were  made to external constituents.  The overall response rate was  52.5%.  The survey was augmented by one - on - one interviews conducted by the TrippUmbach team.   Figure 3 below summarizes response data.   
p3031
aV CICEP New Metrics of University Economic Contributions     Despite the challenges of collecting similar metrics data in parallel with the TrippUmbach   efforts  related to the Economic Impact Report, the Project Committee decided to acquire both data sets  simultaneously. The CICEP metrics data has not yet been fully evaluated, but we believe we have  collected all of the prescribed data, and are well - posit ioned to submit an application for award, if  appropriate.
p3032
aVThe processes described above reinforced certain points, whil e highlighting areas where the U niversity   on efforts,   y were chosen to represent the U  accomplishments. These areas were recognized by both internal and external stakeholders as being   ment in the region.     The process also confirmed beliefs that there are opportunities for improvement in engagements with  industry, management and reporting of students and faculty public service activities, and coordination  of economic engagement activitie s across the  University   (see Section 3     Growth Areas).     C.   Economic Engagement Enterprise     Economic Engagement at the University of Pittsburgh is facilitated by a series of interrelated  partnerships: partnerships with government, industry, and other educatio nal institut ions to leverage  and apply the U   revitalize the communities that hous e our campuses, and help the citizens of those communities to  live healthier and more prosperous lives.
p3033
aVCarnegie Mellon University .  The U niversity inves  underserved neighborhoods, sponsors more than 70 community - focused research initiatives within 16  of our schools/colleges, is integrating technology management and entrepreneurial support programs  camp us - wide, and is serving as an economic anchor in the towns served by our four regional  campuses.     
p3034
aV6   This vision of economic engagement and the activities required to implement this view are enabled by  leadership and direction from the  University  nd Chancellor, and resources allocated by   the  Provost.  Activities are often coordinated with Carnegie Mellon and other regional partners via the  Director of Joint Economic Development Initiatives. The  University   also engages in many taskforces,  and  advisory boards ;   and coordinates some of its most innovative an d   important community  interaction through its  Institute of Politics .
p3035
aV  relative to the Carnegie  Engagement Classifications and th e Kellogg Commission definition   is provided in Appendix A.     D.   Economic Engagement Planning     As cited throughout this application, the University of Pittsburgh has been widely recognized for its  e conomic engagement activities.  Innovative practices in collaborative research, workforce training,  and neighborhood revitalization are highlighted in Section 2. An integral part of the Pitt culture  involves   encouraging, supporting, recognizing and rewardin g activities that benefit the communities  where we serve as   anchor institution s .  This culture, which is reinforced at the highest levels of the  University   (Appendix B), is reflected in programs, research agenda s , and curriculum throughout the  institution.  Figure 4 below summarizes the engagement of 16 schools/colleges and their  77 academic  outreach programs.  Details on the programs are provided in Appendix C.
p3036
aV   The  University   spends more than $70M each year on these programs and related economic  engagemen t and public service activities.   However, the APLU process reinforced what earlier  evaluations had revealed; there are areas where the  University   can improve its performance to the  benefi t of the communities we serve.  Implementing a centralized clearinghou se to promote, manage,  document, and report on the service activities of faculty, staff and students will increase participation,  improve operational efficiency, and enable the  University   to te ll its story more effectively.  Likewise,  the  University   is enga ged in two high level initiatives to improve its performance related to cor porate  relations, and collaboration   with local government and business to attract new research facilities to the  region (Section 3C).   It is also recognized that a more cohesive and   coordinated strategy  regarding economic engagement will enable the  University   to have  an even greater impact on the communities we serve. To raise the  profile and signify the importance of economic engagement,  economic development has been designated as o ne of the three  key tenets of the new Innovation Institute.  The Institute, reporting  to the Provost, will serve as the focal point for all  University   economic engagement activities. The institute represents a  
p3037
aV7   significant investment of resources as the  University   has committed funds to expand and refurbish  existing facilities, and offset costs associated with operational disruptions and colocation of personnel.   More information about the Institute is available in Section 3A.     E.   Promotion & Communications     A public university the size and scope of the University of Pittsburgh has many diverse internal and  external stakeholders that must be communicated with  on a regular basis.  Figure 5 depicts some of   on channels.
p3038
aV   The  University   has strategies to address both incoming and outgoing communications with all of these  stakeholders. Format constraints of this application do not allow for an explanation of each, so we  offer a representative subset.     State  Government   represents an especially important group of stakeholders. As a State - Affiliated  Institution, Pitt receives financial support from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. A recent series of  across - the - board budget cuts have impacted the  University  propriation. The state appropriation is  currently  about   7% of the   total operating budget.  T he  University   engages in a constant  cycle of meetings, briefings, and hearings with State legislators and administration officials that focus  on the eco nomic impact of the  University   and emphasize the incredible return on investment that the  State receives each year. Those benefits are highlighted each year in the  Budget Presenta tion to the  General Assembly , which is prepared to coincide with the annual state budget cycle.     Community Groups and Campus Neighbors   have become important partners for the  University   as  discussed in Neighborhood Revitalization, Section 2A. The  University   has found that face - to - face  meetings are the most effective way to communicate with neighborhood economic development  organizations and planning commissions. The  University   participates in monthly meetings with many  such organizations including:
p3039
aVCommunications with faculty and  staff are facilitated by the traditional  University   forums:  Faculty  Senate, Staff Council, Council of Deans, etc.   The  University   also conducts targeted surveys. In 2011,  the University hired Redwind, LLC. to survey Pitt  inventors. The survey findings,  which were  subsequently  reinforced  through APLU Self - Study process, ser ved as  the initial impetus for th e changes outlined in Section 3A  and 3 C.     Another important internal communication strategy  involves recognition of community service by  university   leadership. Each year, the Chancellor and Provost host  two meetings to reco gnize the service contributions (economic engagement is a common theme) of  Pitt faculty and staff from all five campuses. The selection process is rigorous, and this  University - wide  recognition serves to reward and encourage service to the community.   Inte rnally - focused publications are an important conduit for faculty, staff,  student and alumni communications. The  University   maintains a highly - regarded staff of professional writers, editors, graphic artists, social media  experts, and photographers. Their w ork product enables the  University   to  tell its story internally, allowing faculty and staff to see the wider  implications of their work at the  University .     Many local journalists are Pitt alumni, helping the  University   receive the  local media coverage necessary to  communicate our engagement  activities to external stakeholders  such as government officials, the business community, and  potential students and their parents. To further facilitate  distribution of the  Universi ty  experts available for media and others to contact directly. The  University   also places ads in regional publications to communicate   economy and service to   the community.

Pitt / Carnegie Mellon Partnership   The Pittsburgh region has benefited greatly from a close, collaborative relationship  between Pitt and  its academic partner and Pittsburgh neighbor, Carnegie Mellon University. The magnitude   of the  partnership is largely the   result of a personal friendship that developed when Pitt Chancellor Mark  Nordenberg welcomed Jerry Cohon to his new r ole of President at CMU in 1998.

p3045
aV The breadth and depth of the unprecedented  partnership has been widely hailed and cited in  numerous publications. When Dr. Cohon retired in  2013, the partnership was successfully transitioned  to his successor, Dr. Subra Suresh. Chancellor Nordenberg and Dr . Suresh have continued a longtime  tradition of convening quarterly meetings of their most senior staffers to di scuss matters of joint  interest, focusing on opportunities for joint economic engagement.     Partners in Education     Joint  Pitt/CMU  programs at the   graduate and undergraduate levels span education, philosophy,  physics, computational biology, and medicine. Shared library services (CMU students borrow 3 , 500 to  4,000 volumes from the Pitt Library system of over 6.2M print volumes) and joint career fairs   are

aVfaculty and students benefit from their proximity and spirit  of collaboration.     Partners in Research     Pitt and CMU  collaborate on more than a dozen major research projects every year.  Protocols for  proposal   generation, IP management, cross billing, project management ,   and reporting are well  established.    Highlights of the research partnership include:

aV     B . Neighborhood Revitalization     The   University of Pittsburgh system comprises the 132 - acre campus in the Oakland neighborhood of  Pittsburgh and regional campuses in Bradford, Greensburg,  Johnstown, and Titusville, PA.   On each  campus, the University of Pittsburgh is engaged in neighborhood  revitalization, local capacity building,  and community partnerships, making it a critical anchor in community engagement. The regional  campuses have active and engaged advisory boards to ensure that commun ity input is incorporated  into u niversity strategie s and plans. Together,   the four regional campuses generate $ 90.1 million  dollars of gross economic product in those Western Pennsylvania regions and $60 million in annual  personal income.

aV14   C. Workforce Development   Driving Economic Rebirth     Perhaps the most important contribution the University of Pittsburgh has made related to the   demise of the steel industry and related manufacturing sectors.     In the late 1970s, unemployment in the Pittsburgh region exceeded 17% and the workforce was  shrinking.  Our region experienced an outward migration of skilled workers who were leaving in  pursuit of employment opportunities.  The region was  losing 50,000 re sident s per year;   mostly  you nger, skilled workers and their  families.     T he  University   of Pittsburgh played a pivotal role in bolstering and  transforming the regional economy in the late 1980s and 1990s by  emphasizing education and medicine. In less than three decades, the   he  most important in the Pittsburgh economy, employing more than   Pittsburgh, and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) are  the two largest employers in the region with 1 3,370 and 57,000  employees respectively.

PittServes   Building on a long - standing commitment to its city, re gion, and state, the University of Pittsburgh  impacts its community in many ways  educational, of course, but, also, economic, civic, and cultural.  From its leadership and staff, to its academic units and their faculty, and from its students to its  athletic   and ancillary services, the University of Pittsburgh strives to maintain its legacy of civic  partnership in keeping with its mission statement that reads, in part:

aV[M]ake   available to local communities and public agencies the expertise of the University in ways that  are consistent with the primary teaching and research functions and contribute to social, intellectual,  and economic development in the Commonwealth, the natio n, and the world.     The University began to formalize and more actively promote its capabilities in   2000 and 2004 when  Pitt received   Community   Outreach   Partnership   Centers   (COPC)   grants from   HUD for students, faculty,  and staff to collaborate with community organizations on topics such as housing improvement,  neighborhood revitalization, job training, education, and youth development in Oakland and  surrounding neighborhoods. In one COPC - funde d activity, Pitt students hosted business development  and job training workshops and one - on - one consultations for interested residents.
p3090
aV  When federal funding for COPC ran  out, the  University   used internal  funds to maintain financial support  for the program.   Current campus - based programs include:  Alternative  Break, America Reads, Jumpstart,  MLK Day of Service, Pitt Make a  Difference Day, Pitt Pantry Project,  and Pitt Project Oakland. Pitt st udents  also participate in service programs at 29 community   partnerships and nonprofits (Appendix C ).     To date, student participation in service activities continues to grow.   In 2013, more than 16,000  students contributed in excess of 430,000 hours of com munity service and 480 students were  engaged in formal service - learning programs.
p3091
aV   The challenge of coordinating and documenting the service contributions of thousands of students and  hundreds of faculty and staff has also grown. The magnitude of the c hallenge became apparent in  2013 when the  University   was considering an application to receive the Carnegie Community  Engagement Classification.  The  University   did not have a tracking system in place to accurately report  student internship and volunteer h ours, which is one of the requirements in the application.   After an evaluation of the available options, the University contracted with No bleHour and launched  PittServes in 2014.
p3092
aV   The Office of   PittServes   is intended to serve as a marketplace for  civic engagement, connecting individual students and student  organizations who want to engage in community   service.    And the  new tracking syst em will increase our capacity to serve, our ability  to manage our faculty and student engagements, increase service  to our partners, and track and report on or progress.

University research pro vides the base for an important part of America's most  competitive innovations. This funding deterioration has implications for both educational and research  programs in the long - run.    An overview of this issue is available in  Forging a Foundation for the  Future: Keeping Public Research Universities Strong .   During April 2010,   A P L U   conducted   a series  of regional meetings of member presidents and chancellors, provosts and research vice presidents to  discuss a range of issues including:    improving institutional alignment with state needs, federal  payment for the full research costs of facilities   and administration,   and federal supplementation of     http://www.aplu.org/page.aspx?pid=1571     The results of the 2010 meetings were presented to the National Academies and  included in a report to Congress as part of the 2012 publication,  Research  Universities and the Future of America.     To bring visibility to the issues identified in the report, th e National Research  Council scheduled a series of regional meeting to discuss the findings.  The  University of Pittsburgh hosted the first meeting in November of 2012, and  supported the organizers of subsequent meetings across the country.     The contributor s to the report were prophetic in their pessimism regarding federal  funding levels.  As the figure below illustrates, most federal agencies have frozen  or reduced annual funding, including the NIH which is a major source of funding  for Pitt.

This position will serve to  coordinate all activities rela ted to corporate interaction.    The new Director now convenes a monthl y  meeting of  those  with corporate stakeholders, including  those in  administrat ive functions. The director  is   documenting and  benchmarking   the  University    and has funding  available to add additional resources as appropriate.     The second major university initiative is a collaborative effort with Carnegie Mellon University, local  government leaders, and the business community. As part of this effort, Pitt is convening a series of  meetings with senior staff from CMU, Pitt, the May  Conference on Community Development (ACCD).

aV15     Conclusion     Through the IEP process   of deep self - study , we have had the opportunity to examine our  strengths and successes, explore and embrace our growth points, and engage more closely with  our stakeholders to  move our university and community forward.  As a young university, while  we encounter obstacles that a more established institution might not encounter, particularly  around philanthropy and alumni tradition, we benefit from being  agile, young,  and  able to  move  quickly to change course, adapt to new circumstances,  and overcome barriers.   W e must ensure  that we communicate regularly and through multiple channels to tell our story,  and   engage our  stakeholders and the wider community   to move toward our shared fu ture.

aV  We are grateful for the opportunity to engage in this process for a second time and to our original  reviewers for their insight and encouragement to approach the process with new eyes.  It enabled  us to learn from our community, reorient our think ing around economic engagement, establish  new internal and external collaborations, strive  to  engage and communicate with our  stakeholders at every level.

aV   I. Introduction  Seven years after its merger with Medical University of Ohio (MUO) The University of Toledo  is providing leadership in promoting innovation and prosperity to metropolitan Toledo.   UT interprets the concepts of innovation and ec onomic prosperity beyond technology transfer    quality public schools, access to post-secondary and continuing educational opportunities, access   to high-quality health care, talent development; a modern transportation network, safe and   diverse neighborhoods; sustainable development; and vibrant community arts, recreation, and   culture.   Table 1 provides summary data on  UT and Table 2 provides information on the economy of  metropolitan Toledo.  Since 2000 UT has taken steps to move from a purely passive laissez-faire  approach to regional economic development (e conomic base and independent faculty  contributions) to an aggressive generative and developmental role.  Examples include:   A merger in 2006 of two universities to create a larger university with the scale to make a  difference as the only resea rch university in the community;   Implementation of a 2001 plan to build the research enterprise and selected areas of   research focus;   A  technology transfer and commercialization office that opened in 2002;   Supporting faculty research and scholarship across all academic programs;   Faculty community outreach;   Effective community and regional partnerships with community agencies, nonprofit   organizations, government agencies, corporations, community colleges, other regional  universities, local school systems, and hospitals and health-care systems that expand and   strengthen educational offerings;     A  teaching medical center and outpatient care system that addresses complex medical  conditions and serves as a safety-net hospital for the   fortunate;   A  plan in 2003 to develop Toledo -energy cluster (NSF funded) and  greenhouse  cluster  (USDA  funded);   UT Innovation Enterprises, which administers a $10 million fund to support investments  in spinoff firms  and entrepreneurship, including a student business plan competition;    The  $18.8 million Wright Center for Photovoltaics and Commercialization that supports   -energy cluster ;   Four university  business incubators   businesses ;   Eighteen research centers with many focusing on local problems, including the  health of   Lake Erie,  diabetes and obesity, urban problems, transportation, and global  competitiveness;    A   land-use blueprint best illustrated by the $19 million Gateway Project that created a  college-town atmosphere with restaurants, shops, a bookst ore, and student living spaces;     Research and technical support programs for industry;   College-based industry advisory boards that provide input on current job needs and trends   to improve curriculum and research programs;    Workforce and leadership development programs that support affordability and   accessibility, address the shortage of local health professionals,  promote professional

Award experience   After President Lloyd Jacobs received an invitation to participate in the Award process, a 12- member committee of faculty members a nd administrators met regularly and reviewed APLU  documents to collect information and data, to recomm end three exemplary activities and three  needing improvement, and to identify three c ase studies.  A  university-wide survey using CICEP assessment tools was administered to gauge the  understanding of faculty, staff, and students related to    development efforts. The  survey responses showed that across the institution facult y and staff members have a clear,    support efforts to advance economic prosperity.    Also  semi-structured 60-90 minute interviews based on CICEP tools were conducted with 27  external economic developme nt le aders and business representatives to assess their perceptions   . The interviews were transcribed and led  to our selection of areas where UT is making  exceptional contributions and areas where  challenges exist (Table 3).    sential to   economy. Toledo is often compared to Detroit  so leaders are concerned  that the process that pushed Detroit into bankruptcy might occur in Toledo.   The process identified three areas where UT is ma king exceptional and positive contributions.    First,  UT has demonstrated its commitment to regional innovation and economic  prosperity,  including leadership in technology-cluster development and is actively  engaged in efforts to transform the r egion. President Jacobs has written and spoken  extensively that the health and viability  of UT is inextricably linked to the region and is  often the first person external stakeholders  contact on economic engagement issues. He  serves on  the boards of the Regional Growth Partnership, the Toledo-Lucas County Port  Authority, and the Toledo Regional Chamber of  Commerce.    Second, UT  contributes to local talent development. An example is the engineering co-op  program that provides student workers to companies who are o ften hired upon  graduation.  UT is addressing critical health-care industry workforce issues through its  professional degree programs in medic ine, nursing, pharmacy and other health  professions.    Third,    technology  transfer and  commercialization programs help promote technology entrepreneurship and business  development.  The process noted challeng es which are described in the improvement plan.   First,    is not being  communicated effectively to some target audiences.    Second,  leaders  stressed that  better  connections between faculty  members  and their  programs to the community  are needed . Some stakeholders  do not feel connected to  faculty experts, or have a good understanding of the type of expertise at the university .  Third, UT must not lose sight that its core primary mission is to build strong, high-quality  academic programs and not allow  an economic development focus impair its educational

aV   III. Economic engagement enterprise  UT has undergone rapid changes to its academic programming, administrative structure, and  physical plant since its merger. Few  universities have merged to increase their footprint  to be a  stronger economic development force. Part of the rationale for the merger is the awareness that   universities with larger and higher quality  research programs are more successful in generating  regional change.    Despite remaining challenges, the institution has shown an ability to provide leadership to  regional innovation and prosperity goals as summarized following the C ICEP evaluation criteria  below.  Institutional Development of the Economic Development Enterprise   A  modest-size research university cannot transform a regional economy alone but can  bring together regional leaders to f orm  a shared development vision . In addition to   UT is promoting  knowledge  valorization through technology transfer and commercialization, addressing quality-of -  life issues, addressing community-d evelopment issues, partnering on specific projects,  and  supporting cultural and artistic activities in Toledo.

Through its work in developing its strategic planning documents and the CICEP  Application,  UT identified  strengths and challenges .  Major  UT strengths include a commitment to promote regional prosperity, the leadership  provided by President Jacobs as a voice in the co mmunity, and the support to faculty and  staff to work on community projects. UT recognizes its strengths in engineering and  health education, understands how to connect to national organizations and federal R&D   agencies, has a good track record in marshaling faculty expertise to address local   challenges,  and has good ties to the Ohio Third Frontier Project.  UT supports Governor   priorities,  but has pushed state leaders  to invest  in basic university  research to bring forward innovations for the future .

aVThe Relevant University , a  2010 book written by Dr. Jacobs and Eva Klein, informed  university economic development strate gic thinking with its focus on human capital,  innovation system, health care and wellness, and quality of place.   Financial and staff resources are allocated for economic engagement.   Resources for economic development and engagement  are  identified during annual  budgeting process.   Strategically funded initiatives include moving the technology transfer office to the base  budget (instead of supported by royalty revenue), purchase of a building for   incubator,  investment of $10 million into Innovation Enterprises, investment in  leadership  to the solar energy and greenhouse clusters, providing $30 million for the new  Interprofessional Immersive Simulati on Center, and funds for new faculty in engineering,  photovoltaics and clinical sciences.  Overall Innovation   UT d emonstrates innovation in economic engagement.  It is an example of how a modest- size university, acting as the sole research university in a lagging industrial city, can  make positive change by placing  regional economic development as a university mission.     A process for maintaining continuous dialogue with key regional political, civic and  business leaders is in place through monthly lunches coordinated by  UT that share  information on collaborative opportunities. This process drew commendation from the  Higher Learning Commission.    UT has been able to prioritize and invest in selected initiatives that relate to regional  needs and opportunities.   UT pays  attention to a broad array  of contributors. It partners with local officials on  development projects, including investments to improve  local neighborhoods, address  social challenges, recruitment of companies, international initiatives, and joint initiatives  for transportation and regional development.

aVThe University of Toledo:  A Transformative Force for Building a New Innovation Economy:  Pursuing a Vision of a New Energy Economy: Solar  Many people think of Toledo as a blue collar, rust-belt, manuf acturing city largely supporting the  automotive industry.  Some people know that Toledo has had a  rich heritage in glass technology,  starting with the invention of the  first automatic glass bottling machine  and some of the first  automotive and  tempered sheet glass technologies .  However, few people outside of the solar   energy technology.  The University of Toledo has been parlaying this glass technology know-  how into the foundation for a vibrant thin-film solar energy cluster.  The university not only   supported the cluster through research center s and academic programs, but helped provide the  leadership in shaping the vision that the region  can be a national or even global center for an  emerging industry that promises opportunities for regional economic growth and prosperity.    The University of Toledo has accomplished this through the hard work of its faculty members,  the development of academic programs, the investment in new centers and facilities, and also   serving as a convener to bring together state and local leaders to support the development of this   new cluster.  In addition, the University advanced the cluster through the development of   programs and policy at the state level and promoting   initi atives.  This includes taking a leadership role in promoting funding for solar energy in the   Third Frontier Project  and helping to form a statewide organization that was instrumental   renewable energy portfolio .    The University helped to position the region as a leader in a particular solar energy technology,   thin-film photovoltaics, by building upon the stren gths of the antecedent Toledo glass industry  cluster.  While companies and regions elsewhere in the world were establishing expertise in first- generation photovoltaics (crystalline silicon), The University of Toledo and local companies with  connections to the University were working to perfect thin-film photovoltaics.  The origins of the   Toledo solar cluster can be traced to the work of  local entrepreneurs in the late 1970s and 1980s  that came from the glass industry but saw opportunities in adapting their understanding of glass   production and coatings to the solar energy industry.  These entrepreneurs located on the campus   of The University of Toledo and sought technical assistance from the University who responded   by hiring a physicist in 1987 with expertise in thin- film technology.  The new industry-university  team was successful in winning state and federal awards in support of solar energy development.    The company later attracted external investors a nd moved to nearby Perrysburg, Ohio and is now  First Solar , the largest producer of solar panels in the U.S.  In addition to First Solar, and the  local companies in its supply chain, the Toledo cluster includes other solar panel companies such   as  Xunlight , Lucintech , Willard & Kelsey , and  Calyxo USA , who all benefit from University  technical support and draw upon its graduates for its workforce.  Additionally, the cluster  includes companies that provide glass and other materials to the industry, those that install and  finance solar systems, and other companies .  The region boasts the full range of the solar supply  chain from panels to racking systems and eve rything in between.  Toledo also has deep  intellectual property expertise in its law firms t o support patent applications and intellectual  property support.     The primary source of university support to the cluster has been the attraction of faculty talent in  solar energy.  In addition to their research, faculty members have been supervising graduate

aV  The University of Toledo:  A Transformative Force for Building a New Innovation Economy:   Deploying Resources to Meet Industry Needs: Lab- to-Launch  The University of Toledo  took a leadership role in developing technology and nurturing  entrepreneurship by investing in  technology transfer  in order to drive success, enrich student  work related education and develop inventions derived from basic research into commercially  viable products. Toward these goals, it cre ated a robust pathway for university discoveries to  move from the lab to successfully launch int o the market through its  Lab- to-Launch  program.   The program utilizes an innovative process that serves three purposes:   1) Provides the inventor with much-needed industr y feedback;   2) Engages  potential licensees who may be interested in sponsored research or entering  into a license to commercialize the technology ;  3) Provides funding to UT inventors to develop early-stage inventions into commercially  viable  products.   The  Lab- to-Launch  program partners faculty, staff and student inventors with  Technology  Transfer  staff, as well as representatives from  Rocket Ventures  and  Innovation Enterprises , all of  whom work together to  help verify the commercial potential of ideas and inventions; advise in  areas such  as financing, marketing, business plan development , and  personnel; connect  university inventors with appropriate industry leaders;  offer advice to help transform innovative  platform technologies into the bases for successful spin -off businesses; and smoothly facilitate  the transfer of those discoveries an d innovations to the marketplace.  The team works  to promote  highly potential technologies with the intent of expediting the transfer of innovations into  commercial products and services while placing particular emphasis on regional economic   development by targeting partners  like  Acense , which is located in northeast Ohio.

A  technology transfer representative meets with the inventor and the company to explore details of   the invention and  learn  the opinion of industry about the current stage of the technology and the  most appropriate direction toward commercial development. If the industry representative feels   that the technology has potential but needs further work to be commercialized, the technology  transfer team helps secure funding for comme rcialization efforts from a number of sources, such  as the Ohio    Technology Validation and Start-Up Fund .

aVThe University of Toledo  College of Engineering instituted a mandatory cooperative education  program  in 1997.  This program is one of only eight engineering schools in the entire nation to  require  a co -op  experience as a condition of graduation.  The UT mandatory co-op program require s all engineering undergraduates to complete a  minimum of three semesters of work experienc e as part of their curriculum.   The work  experience must involve the students in eng ineering-related projects or programs and can be at  industrial, government, or at the sites of other organizations (e.g., hospitals, educational   institutions).  Although three semesters of co-op are required, many engineering students   complete additional co- ops prior to graduati on.  As a result, all of the UT engineering  undergraduates graduate with a minimum of  one year of work experience.  Many of the students  find employment following graduation in t he companies where they worked while a student.  The mandatory co-op program has continue d to grow.  Since 1999, over 13,000 students have  been placed in engineering co -op positions a t approximately 1,900 employer sites throughout the  U.S. and even at 36 international locations.  Table  1 shows the placements of engineering co-op  in Northwest Ohio.  The impact of our co-op  program on Northwest O hio is significant.  Over the past year alone, the  College has placed e ngineering co-op students in 557 positions throughout Northwest Ohio.    Our  co-op program has been instrumental in supporting Northwest Ohio to prosper by providing  access to our engineering talent.  Over 5,500 UT  co-op students have been placed at over 527  companies in Northwest Ohio alone.  Not only does the company bene fit directly by having a  technically competent student at its site, but through the co-op program the company develops  connections to UT engineering faculty members who are able to help address challenging   industry problems.  This talented pool of engineering students has allowed employers to hire cost   effective labor, without the added cost of benefits.   All of our students are required to carry  medical insurance, thus, relieving  companies of this expense.    The economic impact of our engineering  c o-op program on Northwest Ohio is sizable with  almost 40 percent of the total co-op placements ove r the pa st year in the local region.   Our  students earn an average wage  of $16.75 per hour which equates to an average of $10,720 per  co-op semester.  Five-hundred fifty-seven placements multiplied by $10,720 per co-op semester  equates to a total payroll of $5,971,040 over the p ast year for our engineering  co-ops employed  in Northwest Ohio.    Upon graduation, many o f these students are offered full-time positions at the companies they  worked.  Because so many students are placed in Northwest Ohio, many former students  continue to contribute to the overall economic health of Northwest Ohio and provide technical

aVName  Title  Comments  Jeff  Joldrichsen   Vice  President of  Operations , North Star BlueScope Steel  LLC  I was fortunate as a University of Toledo  undergraduate in  engineering to have the opportunity to work part -time as an  engineering trainee.   This part - time position not only helped  define the field of engineering that I wanted to pursue but also  helped fund my education.   The skills and education  I gained  from this job and the University of Toledo helped set the  foundation for my future.   Now as a Vice -President of  Operations for a multi -national steel producer in northwest  Ohio, my company utilizes the University of Toledo as an  important resourc e as we continually look to grow our business  and provide positive returns to the stakeholders in our business.  Tracy  Momany   Vice President of  Professional  Services,   Plastic Technologies  I held an engineering internship starting the end of my 3rd year  of college, working part -time during the school year, and full - time during the summer. This was an essential part of my  engineering education. I learned to apply my engineering  training to real world situations, and through this gained greater  understandi ng and appreciation of engineering, technology, and  business. Upon graduation, I remained with the company I had  interned with, Plastic  Technologies, Inc. and have advanced in  my career to be a vice president in charge of three departments  and a board memb er of the company. I can credit the internship  with providing me the opportunity to learn, but perhaps more  importantly to earn a starting position in what has be en a very  dynamic organization.  Craig   Bowie   Chief Administrative Officer,   SSOE Group   My  experiential education provided me the confirmation I  needed that I had chosen the right career for me and led to a  full -time job offer immediately upon graduation.   My career at  SSOE, Inc. has included many opportunities in the 32 years  since graduation.   Today as a Sr. Vice President and Director  on SSOE Board, I am transitioning from my former role as  Manager of International Operations to my new role a s Chief  Administrative Officer.  Steve  Wesolowski  Sr. Director of Global  Engineering ,  Dana Holding Cor poration  I will always be grateful to The University of Toledo for  facilitating my experiential education.   It was during my junior  year when key professors encouraged me to transfer what I  learned in the classroom to industry by pursuing an engineering  student position at Toledo based Dana Corporation.   I look  back at that early opportunity as a crucial three -way partnership  (University  - Company  - Student) which formed the foundation  for my engineering career.   That collaborative groundwork still  serves m e well today here in Northwest Ohio, as Dana develops  new innovative power conveyance and energy management  solutions for the wo rld's future sustainability.

aV  Growth/Improvement Plan   , using the APLU assessment tools, through  both the internal assessment and the external semi-struc tured interviews, identified areas of  improvement that UT should address to enhance its contribution to reg ional innovation and  economic prosperity.    First, a repeated theme was that  UT can improve its communication approaches and that its  economic development message is not being communicated effectively to target audiences.  Interviewees, while positive about UT and its critical role in regional development, stated that   they do not know about many of the activities underway. Improved communication, they   underscored, would enhance their knowledge about important events, strategic initiatives, and     Second, leaders stressed that better connections are needed between faculty and their programs to  the community. Some stakeholders do not feel connected to faculty experts or have a good  understanding of the type of expertise at the university.   Third, UT must not lose sight that its core primary mission is to build strong, high-quality  academic programs and not allow an economi c development focus impair its educational  mission. Also, some say that UT can be more responsive in establishing new academic programs   to meet industry needs.

In  addition, UT offers professional degrees in education, law, business, and engineering, and a vast  array of undergraduate and graduate degree programs in the humanities, social sciences, and   physical and natural sciences. In many ways, UT is similar to a land-grant university.    The lack of stakeholder understanding and knowledge  about some aspects of the university  economic engagement is somewhat baffling given the great efforts made to market the university  and publicize university activities and accomplishments.

The university enjoys good relationships with the community leaders and with reporters and  editors from the local newspaper, and from loc al radio and television stations. Efforts to maintain  those relationships will continue.   The board of trustees, President Jacobs and other top administrators will continue to regularly  engage the governor and other state higher-educational policymakers and actively share the     work with local legislators, mayors, and other local political and community leaders and are   involved in local and regional boards.  UT will continue to regularly  identify community needs and involve stakeholders in planning . Numerous external stakeholders  participate  following the merger.    group or are members of university -industry advisory boards that offer input on curricular  planning and research.    External stakeholders and community economic development leaders have understandable  communication expectations. It appears they would like an easy- to-access, efficient, and  consistent place to locate information about the university, particularly scheduled events. Not   using it every day, some stakeholders found the  UT website difficult to navigate to find the  information they need. Efforts should continue to improve the effectiveness and usability of the   UT website.  An important first step might be establishment of an electronic outreach system that would  enable UT to quickly send important tailored information to key economic development   community members.  II. Improved connec tedness between faculty and community  The  finding that more must be done to reconnect the research needs of industry with university  faculty expertise will require making in formation on   research expertise more easil y  accessible.     and other community  outreach efforts.   interest t o increase the visibility and accessibility of faculty expertise so that  community stakeholders view the university as  a research leader and are knowle dgeable of the  relevance, capacity and potential of UT r esearch.  Also, faculty members must be encouraged to  participate in local, state and national publi c-policy discussions in such areas of science,  
p3237
aV  healthcare, civil rights, the economy, and law.  Furthermore, UT faculty and administrators need  to be abreast of best practices on ways unive rsities promote economic development.  Many faculty members are already highly connected and offer their expertise to a wide range of  public agencies, industry, national prof essional groups, and non-profit organizations  mostly  through their own efforts on topics that range from human sex trafficking and school bullying  to the ecological health of Lake Erie and legal issues in sports. UT should continue to encourage  faculty members to serve on local, state and nation al groups and share their knowledge and  expertise. Two important initial steps include promoting the UT database of faculty expertise a s well as web sites that provide information on  s  research labs, centers and institutes, and  special databases.  It appears that some stakeholder s are most knowledgeable and are most comfortable interacting  with the university at the level of departments, colleges or specialized centers, not at the  institutional level. The university has ex perienced significant budget pressure stemming from the  2008 collapse of the national econom y, a nd significant organizational change resulted.  Stakeholders may not appreciate the c hanges in UT resources now available to support the  communication programs they expect.    equipment but a greater effort is needed to provide this information to external stakeholders so   that they can make proper connections to support the ir needs.  Although there is some truth to the comments raised by the external stakeholders, part of the   challenge relates to communications with them about faculty initiatives underway to enhance   academic programs.   Improved comm unication and enhanced stakeholder and constituent  connections will allow UT to meet many goals outlined in the  Directions 2011. Directions 2011  includes 40 metrics to measure institutional success in the areas of undergraduate academic  programs; graduate and professional academic programs; research, technology transfer and  incubation; learning environment; health-care access and delivery; arts and humanities;  and   outreach and global engagement.  The importance of tying partnerships, outreach, and  engagement to student teaching and academic achievement is evident in virtually every major   section, goal, and strategy of the plan.  III. Maintain focus on core academic mission, support new program development, and  retain the Urban Affairs Center  The  third challenge stakeholders identified    legacy to  provide higher education  opportunities for the residents of metropolitan Toledo and to be a vehicle for fulfillment of  educational aspirations and achievement . Historically, many UT graduates were the first in their  families to attend college and often ca me from backgrounds where limited financial resources  precluded a private school education. Many graduates have express ed appreciation for what a UT  degree did in shaping their lives and broadening their minds.   Many stakeholders, many of whom are  UT graduates, want to see the university rise in stature as  a strong research university with hig h-quality academic programs across a broad range of  academic disciplines, including the arts, humanities, and social sciences.  Some feel the  university needs to be more responsive in se tting up new academic programs to meet local needs  more quickly.  In addition, some community leaders expressed concern over the closure of the  
p3238
aV  Urban Affairs Center, a long-standing center that provided independent research and data  support for the community.  In the interviews some external stakeholders also expressed concern that an overemphasis on  technology commercialization ma y weaken  UTcommitment to its core academic mission, shift  faculty    focus from research to business venture initiatives, and reduce  its ability  to be  a source of new knowledge and fundamental expertise to support   .   external stakeholders are loy al and committed and wanted to emphasize how important it s educational mission is to them and to the comm unity.  This is a difficult challenge given the  focus of the State of Ohio in seeing its public universities as ve hicles to form new companies and  create new jobs.  Three barriers stand in the way of successful implement of this plan.   First, like most public universities, UT faces a challenging fiscal future. Outreach and  communication programs require funding. State of Ohio budgetary reductions in recent years,  including the loss of state funding for the Urban Affairs Center, and a decline in federal funding   for research and development will signific antly impact   out its economic development agenda.    -making structures do not lend themselves itself to quick decision-making  and action, which are both strength and a weakness. The concept of shared governance has great  importance, which sometimes slows implementation of proposed initiatives, many of which need   approval by college councils, the Fa culty Senate and sometimes the Board of Regents. In   sometimes  have a bias toward rapid decision -making  and action.  The vetting of new courses and programs may be slow to external stakeholders, but  often the additional scrutiny protects aca demic quality.    Third, the university cannot be all things to all people and must prioritize efforts. Since the  merger, UT has been more strategic and more disc iplined in its choices and has been compelled  to made difficult allocation decisions in order to maintain its firm financial footing.  Despite these caveats, UT has taken steps to improve academic programs to respond to  community needs and develop students who are career ready.  With respect to academic   programs, UT has strived to incorporate a t least two experiential learning opportunities into each  program of study, has invested in its Honors College, has developed  a new college dedicated to  less-prepared students and is building an infrastructure where they can succeed,  and has set up  programs to support innovation in course delivery a nd teaching.  UT has also dedicated resources    rs in delivering effective high-quality courses  that promote active learning.   In 2001, UT analyzed its research enterprise to support faculty research and identify areas of  research focus.  That plan resulted in facult y hires that built strengths in photovoltaics,  environmental sciences, biomedicine, and astrophysics tha t have now reached fruition through  increased standing of these areas.  Partly in response to messages received through the APLU  assessment process, UT will initiate plans for another faculty hiring plan in the  FY13-14.    Finally, in response to the strong support raised through this assessment process, UT was   successful in making support for the Urban Affairs Center a high priority through the state  budgeting process and thus is able to keep the center operating to provide research and data  support to Toledo.

aV (Word Count: 2367/2500)   Introduction     At Utah State University (USU) we are proud of our   achi evements in economic  engagement.  USU  President   Stan Albrecht   gave  Dr.  Robert Behunin, Vice President for  Advancement and Commercialization ,   responsibility for leading the  submission   efforts .   Dr.  Behunin  created   a  primary team  with   five   lead   members.   The   team leads then   engaged with  other  key  univ ersity administrators and staff   from a variety of backgrounds   to gain insight into  specific  programs,  functions
p3269
aVA  working group   of  internal and external constituents was also con sult ed, in which the resu lts of the internal and  external surveys were evaluated and ideas that could be implemented into a growt h and  improvement plan for the U niversity were discussed.   For USU to benefit as much as possible from the designation process , the team decided to  base  its participation on    innovation and economic  prosperity   by focusing on  existing  objectives of the U niversity that are relevant to economic  development.  Appendix A   pr ovides a detailed explanation of how USU interprets the terms   economic engagement  falls in line with   the Carnegie Engagement Classification and the Kellogg Commission  definition s .    Our   submission is based on the   concept  that by drawing from     strengths and  focusing on areas we need to improve, we can further our innovation and economic  impact   throughout the state .  Collaboration among the colleges and regional campuses can encourage  innovation and ,   as a result, d rive   economic prosperity.  In addition, this  process   has given us   a  chance to analyze where  USU   currently   stands   in reaching these objectives and where we want  to  focus   our  future  efforts. As a result we have been able to form  a growth and development plan  to build upon these objectives.    Process Experienc e     Overall, the participation in this program has been one of discovery  and assessment  for  USU   as a whole .  We   adapted the  APLU CICEP   survey   in order to  meet   the needs of a USU - specific   audience   and  to  tailor the content to   our   institution   specifically .  USU    revis ed   survey  eliminate d   any   inapplicable information  encouraging   increased stakeholder participation.     The survey was  developed   using Qualtrics and disseminated via the em ail be low from  Vice President Behunin. It   stress ed    together to move   forward.  A list of key  donors,  government officials, bus iness leaders and alumni that are  con sidered strong external  stakeholders of USU   was compiled .  Likewise, a   list of internal  stakeholders , which included   key   faculty, staff and campus administrators, was also compiled .

By investing in university research with high c ommercialization potential, USTAR   accelerate s   the growth of new businesses and industries, thus creating high - paying jobs, and  providing additional tax revenues   in Utah .  The USTAR program at USU has received  approximately $100M  to date  for the primary purpose of enhancing   .  USTAR  fundin g  currently   enable s   USU  to   fund  12   principal investigators and   4   business development  officers . USTAR also provided funding   to  build a $60M research - to - commercialization facility  that houses a bio safety level 3+ lab, a vivarium, a clinical nutrition cente r, as  well as life science  laboratories .     The first funding for a  USTAR project at USU began in  mid - 2006.   S ince  that time ,  the  USU commer cialization team has  worked   to attract USTAR  professors to USU and to create  additional  research  team s and  projects .  These   teams are formed   around   faculty areas of research  and expertise in an effort to build  on the strengths  and knowledge  of  existing  USU faculty  members.   Once these teams have been established,  intellectual property portfolios are  developed   and the journ ey from basic research to commercialization begins.  The   USTAR   BioInnovations  building  wa s completed in   late 2010   providing many of the resources necessary to house these  teams and projects .

aV  8   Another  primary focus at USU  is to comp lement our  statewide   educational mission by  expanding  our research, commercialization   and economic development programs throughout our  regional campuses. USU, wi th its land - grant tradition of E xtension and outreach  throughout the  state,   helps    his new global economy. Our regional campus  system has experienced tremendous growth over the last few years, bringing additional avenues  for economic engagement and impact within the state as a whole.   Over the last tw o years, USU  has invested in a two - way   interactive video system that  enables   interaction  with its   regional  campuses located in   helps   f ulfill  needs throughout the state such as, distance education, commu nication with community  member s,   and the  dissemination of universit y - based knowledge to the state through webinars and  live  broad cast lectures.    The Bingham Entrepreneurship & Energy Research Center (BEERC) is another example   ghout the state via our regional  campus locations.   from the main campus,  USU supports a six - member team that is housed in t he BEERC . The team  works with local stakeholders (governme nt, education and businesses) to address needs relevant  to energy policy, technology development, environmental sustainability and economic impacts  created by the oil and gas industry. The total USU and local community investment in the  BEERC project now s tands at nearly $78M and continues to grow. The BEERC also houses a  business incubator for start - ups and hosts     Small Business Development  Center s .    The Regional Innovation Gateway (RIG) program is another example of how USU is  striving to provide services and fulfill the needs of entrepreneurs throughout the state. Facilitated  by the commercialization office, this developed platform brings research - to - commercialization  expertise to rural areas of  Utah.  The   RIG program pairs entrepreneurs and businesses with  experts at USU in intellectual property protection and technology development. The program  provides access to technical, business, and innovation e xpertise to develop next - stage technology  attractive to third parties for larger scale commercial development or licensing, and is open to all  business es   or individuals with an idea or prototype for a new technology.    Planning     There are se veral administra tive  changes that have occurred   at USU in recent years    In 2011, under the  direction  of   President Stan   Albrecht, USU created the Office of Commercialization and Regional  Development to levera  ssets .   The focus was to  extend   research mission through the land - grant system as well as   build    capacity. The day - to - day work of the CRD team is to align research, technology and economic  de velopment initiatives to enhance local communities and provide those communities with  greater access to the resources of the land - grant institution.  For more information about the CRD  office please see section one in Accomplishments.    In 2013, President Al brecht, created an even closer alignment by  combining   the  University Advancement  Office  with   the  Commercialization and   Regiona l Development   Office .  As a result, the Vice P resident  for Advancement and Commercialization  now oversees the  fundraising,  commercialization and regional development   activities   for USU. This unique  alignment provides  the  commercialization  office  with acce ss to corporations, foundations   and  alumni who not only contribute philanthropically to USU, but who also have interest in

As USU has brought significant resources and opportunities together, the conversation  with donors, business leaders and government officials h as changed dramatically. That  conversation is now broader, better informed, and gives USU added flexibility in responding to  its diverse set of stakeholders.  Two new positions, t he   Associate Vice President for Alumni and  the Associate Vice President for  Co rporate Relations ,   were   recently created   to help manage these  relationships.   in creating these relationships  are aimed  to advance   the interests of  both parties by  establishing   partnerships  with alumni and corporations that  are   mutually  benefi cial and not   just a philanthropic endeavor.

Howeve r, we remain aware of the potential threats and barriers  that exist as USU is also subject to the political, financial and economic impacts in the  marketplace.  The IEP self - examination process has highlighted, through stakeholder responses,  the  excellent  w ork   that USU is doing and the areas in which greater focus and internal  coordination can be achieved.  We believe that USU is uniquely positioned for success at this  time and are   dedicated to bettering our in stitution and the state of Utah.

An appropriate technology is identified and vetted for   spin - in    potential.   (See Figure 16  for additional information).   2.   Once   identified, the owner of the IP   must assign the IP   rights   to USU in order  for USU to  put resources in to   enhancing the IP.   3.   An equitable  arrangement is made between USU and the IP assignee  regarding  the  ongoing relationship and financial outcomes.    4.

aV  23   Growth/Improvement Plan (Weaknesses/Opportunities )   (Word Count: 1585/2000)   While we recognize that our stakeholders  have identified  the above areas as strengths, we  understand that continued growth and development in these areas is of  utmost  importance in  increasing our economic impact at USU. As we continue to focus on these areas,  we   will also  seriously consider the areas of weakness   that were highlighted in the survey. Based on the  percentage of individuals who disagreed or strongl y disagreed, it was  evident that  USU needs  to  improve   in the  following three areas.   1. Increase communication efforts both internally and externally about   development contributions.     One  major area for   growth and improvement that was  identified during   this submission  process , in addition to those areas identified by the survey, is the need for increased  communications both internally and externally.  Creating and implementing a new section into   communication   plan , that focuses on economic engagement efforts   at   USU   will  help alleviate this particular  concern .  Stakeholders need to be aware of the avenues available for  dissemination of economic engagement stories as they relate to their particular area of  r esponsibility. The creation of this new section in our   com munications plan will also help  alleviate some of the existing confusion surrounding available avenues and what role each  stakeholder should play.    In order to develop and  implement  this  section into our  communication s   plan, we  will   explore the possibility   of creating an   Economic Development Coordinating Council  that involves  both  university  and   community leaders.  USU   will  benefit   greatly    -  economic development coordinating council to help leverage existing (but separate) economic  engage ment efforts. A working group with potential committee members has already met to  discuss the results of the survey. The collaboration between these individuals has  already  sparked  some interesting ideas  in relation to economic engagement. S uggestions   were   also made as to  who  should be invited  to participate in this  council  in the future .   Once the council has been  created ,  goals and initiatives will be established in order to  define   a mission and direct deliverable s.   Similar committees have met together in  the past but  have  lacked   the support  necessary   to continue.  Our goal is to create   a structure that provides  simple solutions to problems and  clear communication s   to help  coordinate   our various economic  development activities. The ability to  identify curren t weaknesses USU has i n collaboration with  industry will become clear, as both industry and academic leaders will be in attendance at these  meetings. Development of proper strategies to  improve   these weaknesses will also be  established.     The economic deve lopment council will also be responsible for the   develop ment of   tailored messages for multiple audiences in order to disseminate  correct  information  related to   economic and c ommunity engagement at USU. Our primary goal for the council is to share   informati on  related to our individual and group efforts and then to notify internal and external  stakeholders who could   benefit from these engagement  opportunities and collaboration  possibilities.     Identifying faculty, staff   and community leaders who are involved in economic   -  .  The council  will also  create  a semi - annual  economic d evelopm ent newsletter based  up on the conversations and   initiatives  discussed . A n  
p3317
aV  24   opt - in   listserv will also be created ,   and a website   that  informs stakeholders about the multitude of  resources available   will be maintained.   This  flow of   information   will provide  add itional  opportunities   for faculty, staff, students and community members to more fully engage in the  programs that  have already been  established at USU.  The  initial   creation and management of the  economic development newsletter, listserv and website   will f all under the direction of the  Marketing and Business Development Manager housed in the Office of Commercialization and  Regional Development. As the project grows, additional staffing and/or time from other campus  resources may be necessary.    2. Educating   faculty about opportunities and benefits related to participation in regional  economic development activities & Promoting professional development support for  faculty who undertake economic development and community engagement activities.   ( 23 % of internal  stakeholders)   &  (22% of internal stakeholders)

aV   In addition to the other initiatives that USU has engaged in   to help bolster our economic  and community engagement efforts, USU  also  reward s   researchers for their contributions to  economic engagement. In  a  revision of     reco gnized as  contributions to a professors research or creative e ndeavors required for  advancement and tenure.    While there are benefits and support  available  for faculty who are engag ing in economic  development, such as the above policy, it became clear that  there is  often  a disconnect between  those benefits and faculty know ledge   about  them. We will   make information about these benefits  and support more available as well as enhanc e   other progra ms in the U niversity to promote  professional development support for faculty   who undertake economic development and  community engagement activities.    One of the first things we  will   create and implement is a   USU Commercialization  Handbook.   The   USU Commercialization Handbook  will be distributed to all faculty  members  and  will  inclu de  detailed information about  the steps necessary and  the resources  available to   a id   them as they   transition their research  from the  U niversity to the marketplace.  The creation of this  handbook will   provide faculty members with the knowledge they need to a ppropriately  commercialize university technolo gy, copyrights, know - how, etc.    Additional training  and promotion of the economic development support   currently   available to faculty  w ill   be   enhanced   by  a partnership between the Commercialization Office and  the Office of Research and Graduate S tudies .  The new faculty research training  sponsored   by the  Office of Research and Graduate Studies is a yearlong, seven session, series meant to provide  voluntary research training to new faculty with research as part o f their role statement.   A  partnership   between these two offices will   allow for the implementation of a technology  comm ercialization component into all   new faculty research - training seminars.   Coordination and communication amongst the programs that facilita te bringing industry  members from the community and  industry   to campus will   help educate and promote  professional and economic development at USU.  Programs like t he Entrepr eneur Leadership  Speaker Series and   the Partners in Business Program   can   not only he lp educate faculty about   more about opportunities for engagement within the community and with potential industry  partners.

aV  25   3. Creating a culture of entrepre neurship across the institution, including training and  mentoring opportunities for faculty, students, and community members.   ( 21% of internal and 7% of external stakeholders)     Emphasis and promotion of programs that are already in place will help USU fost er a  culture of entrepreneurship that includes   the   institution as well as community members.   Huntsman School of Business houses the Jeffrey D .   Clark  Center for Entrepreneurship .   The  office of Commercialization and Regional Development engages frequently with the  Clark  Center for Entrepreneurship  and funds   twenty student interns in the center each semester. Here  students and  community  members  can receive   training and mentoring in b usiness start - up s   and  engage  in local, regional and global business and economic development activities.  The center   also  focuses   on improving the classroom instruction for entrepreneurship as well as providing  programs outside of the classroom to  enhance   i nnovative business thinking, new venture  competencies and ethical leadership.  The center was   designed to help student s   develop ideas into  businesses.  In order to promote entrepreneurship, the center  also  hosts an Entrepreneur  Leadership Speaker Series that   is   held every Wednesday, January through April, and is   open to  the public.    Another program to encourage e ntrepreneurship  across the institution  is the Small  Enterprise Education and Development (SEED) Program. This is an internship opportunity for  studen ts of all majors   who desire   to make an impact in the world. Students travel to Ghana or  Peru for a semester to teach sustainable business practices in   an effort   to empower less fortunate  individuals and families. Other programs include several innovation a nd entrepreneurial  competitions with cash pr izes funded by the center. The e ntrepreneurship club is also a  main  focus   of the center and gives a lot of experience to students. The  e - club has divisions  that focus  on   innovative design and creation ,  provide co nsulting services, and market and plan  events.  Students from every college on campus are encouraged to participate. If students with business  ideas  pass through  the  consulting   phase   they are assigned a mentor from the Founders Board.    The Western Rural  Development Center   (WRDC)   is another notable center located  at  USU   that extends region - wide. The WRDC is a regional catalyst for capacity building in the  West that could help foster a culture of entrepreneurship amongst faculty, staff and community  members   who engage with the center. The WRDC  is one of fo ur regional centers established in  the United States   in 1972 as a result of the Rural Development Act.   located at   Michigan State University , Pennsylvania State University   and Missi ssippi State  University. USU   became the h ome   institution for the WRDC in 2000 after  their proposal was  selected over   Oregon    .  The WRDC   works in the 13 western states and four U . S .

It is the vision of the businesses, the  people, and the government that create the landscape for economic prosperity,  a landscape that  would not be complete without higher education providing the necessary innovations and  workforce comprising a competitiv e economy. This is the crux of economic engagement at  Washington State University ; it is not our  university s agenda, but  our engagement with  stakeholders across the state and region , supporting  the ir economic prosperity  agenda  that makes  Washington the be st place to live and do business.   Washington State University s 10 th President, Dr.  Elson S. Floyd , recognized this dynamic  between universities and the regional economy, and in  2007 established  the Office of Economic  Development and Extension , one of the  first university -based economic development offices in  the country . Creating  this centralized office  enabled  WSU to  readily  leverage WSUs core  competencies,  communicate  economic  contributions , and grow  impact  through  stakeholder  partnerships . Given WSUs land -grant mission on the statewide presence of the university (a  physical presence in each of Washingtons 39 counties) the decision was made to locate the  Office of Economic Development in Seattle, the economic hub of Washington State, and  Northwest overall.  The Offices establishment created a positive  shift in  community -engagement  efforts and in  perception of WSU as  a contributor to the regional economy;  WSU  had  a consistent  face  and voice  promoting  its  assets for economic engagement  with ex ternal stakeholders .  However  as many universities experienced  severe budget cuts beginning with the recession of  2008, WSU was not immune to these challenges and, as such,  progress in university economic  development was all but  brought  to a standstill.  Between 2008 and 2010,  a mounting  reorganization of administrative units  to reduce university costs  tasked  Economic Development

This was crushing amount o f work for one office to  manage,  preventing  further  growth  of meaningful engagement  with our stakeholder s. Compounding the setback in engagement efforts, the office underwent a change in leadership  which put  engagement activities on hold.   As with any  challenge , one hopes to emerge smarter, faster, and stronger.  As such, in l ate i n 2011,  a new  Office of Economic Development and External Affairs  (EDEA) emerged  to once  again focus on building relationships with corporations and communities  for economic prosperity . A new  combination  of offices, the EDEA is the umbrell a under which  Economic Development,  Corporate  and Foundation R elations,  Office of C ommercialization, and Small B usiness  Development Centers  operate . Through the application of  CICEPs  Asses sment Tool, New  Metrics, and this  award process, we have been able to identify  several  instances  where  WSU has  excelled in economic engagement , as well as gaps where the university  could  work to integrate  economic development  activities and  effectively articulate the impact of  activities  already taking  place, all of which will drive our work over the next several years.  In this application for the Innovation and Economic Prosperity Award, we highlight  example s of  how WSU is  innovative in economic engagement:   The process of engagin g our ext ernal stakeholders in CICEPs New Metrics Initiative  workshop  which ultimately led to  integration  of  the  Office of Intellectual Property  Administration and  the  WSU Research Foundation into the  Office of Commercialization;    How the new composition of the Of fice Economic Development and External Affairs is  capitalizing on new dynamics in university -industry partnerships;    University growth in  our  economic engagement and how we are planning for  broader  implementation;   Innovative wa ys in which we are promoting and communicating innovation and  engagement accomplishments and our plan to continue growing these  communications ;   Leadership roles EDEA has taken on to help peer institutions participate in these  engagement activities . 9,13$' '%;<=$,*$/3$ %&/2%(#$%;31/14*3%;/($,=,*'$  Over the past  five  years,  WSU  has  participated  in CICEPs New Metrics initiative.

Led by EDEA, the  Office of Institutional Research, Office of Research,  Alumni Relations, campuses and colleges,  the  Office of Intellectual Property Administration  (OIPA) and  the  WSU Research Foundation (WSURF) worked over several months to collect  data, but what we found was  there was no consistent or accurate way to obtain the proposed  metrics.  Nevertheless, in May 2012  we held  an external stakeholder  workshop  to obtain feedback  on the proposed new  metrics  and discuss the role of metrics  in  economic development . The most  important out come of this stakeholder meeting  was  not the assessment of the metrics, or how well  WSU was doing in tracking engagement metrics,  but the recognition of  challenges  OIPA and  WSURF  faced  obtaining  these metrics . More so than in any breakout session, i t was apparent  that  metrics i ncluded  in Knowledge Incubation and Acceleration P rograms  were not relevant to  WSU . However there  was con sensus that we could and must do better in fueling our economy  with  technology  innovation s and their translation into the public domain . What was not evident  was  why  we were underperforming . As a direct result of  the  New Metrics  stakeholder  engagement  workshop , we embarked on a mission to look more closely at why we   a major  land -grant research institution   were underperforming in  commercialization . To answer this question  we engaged a n objective  external consulting firm  with technology  transfer exper tise  to conduct  internal  interviews  with  internal stakeholders  in the pipeline of  technology transfer   provost, deans, chancellors, associate deans for research, OIPA staff,  faculty   to qualitatively  analyze  the current state of technology transfer at WS U. From the  interviews they concluded  that overall,  OIPA  was  operating  in a reactive rather than proactive  manner, failing to identify commercial potential of innovations early on in the pipeline.  Additionally, there was lack of internal understanding of w hen and how to engage OIPA , and the  services they provide to WSU.  A growth plan was put  in place  to develop  this area of WSUs economic enter prise and l ess than a  year later WSU announced the merging of the WSURF and OIPA, creating one entity to serve

To highlight one  immediate  resulting improvement  (the groups were merged and the OC  launched on July 1 2013) , the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, and  the College o f Engineering and  Architecture partnered  with OC  to create new business development positions: licensing  associates now  work  side by side with faculty to identify commercial potential of research  projects and inventions  early on,  and furthermor e they would  work closely with Economic  Development staff to identify potential partners and marketing opportunities  for licensable WSU  technology,  across the state.  These new roles have already engaged more external partners than  would have been possible without them . Furthermore, a nascent, campus -wide entrepreneurial  effort is now underway, with colleges sharing courses, leveling of curriculum, and the creation of  a new entrepreneurship certificate for the first time in WSUs 125 -year history.  With an advisory  board  of industry and tech transfer partners ( including  some  stakeholder workshop  participants ),  we will continue to monitor these improvements for further refinement of staff functions and  services to streamline the process even  further, as well as promote par tnering opportunities .  For example, the OC and Corporate and Foundation Relations (CFR)  have developed  WSUi3 : Where Inn ovation and  Industry  Intersect , which  will launch this  fall . The event  will showcase  premiere university innovations, for the first time  inviting key stakeholders from industry,  government, and prominent alumni to interact with faculty  and  experience  how 10 university  technologies  can improve their lives, their business, and the economy . This will be an  annual  event, garnering media attent ion and potential partner s for  licensing deals  to  generate  deal flow . We believe  internal and external stakeholders  will look forward to  this event  each year for  engagement  in technology transfer at WSU.  Another important  and related  component of the economic engagement enterprise  growth plan  is  strengthening  the relationship between Corporate Relations, Economic Development, and WSU.

Through conducting the APLU Self -Assessment survey, we found that  especially in the areas of  economic engagement culture, engagement with public, and the innovation economy, WSU  Extension and the Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs)  were most often  identified  as  engaged . Combining these two findings, we reason that there is opportunity to leverage existing  relationships developed by WSU Extension within communities to increase impact of additional  university assets.  There are two s uch examples of partnerships that have formed within the last  year that highlight internal engagement for external economic  prosperity . First, EDEA and  WSU Extension  are partnering to increase STEM achievement of middle and  high school students in the Puge t Sound. Through a shared vision of providing a more robust  workforce to fuel the aerospace  and other high -demand  industr ies , our offices are creating a  mentor -training curriculum for professional engineers to  mentor students  in  STEM  programs in  the Puget  Sound region . Led by the Pierce County Extension Office and funded in part by Pierce  County  (a hotbed of aerospace manufacturers) , we are piloting curriculum this coming fall in  Clover Park School District. Anticipated outcomes of this program include an i ncrease of  leadership and mentoring skills for current aerospace workforce and increased math and science  achievement at the targeted schools. Secondary to these direct outcomes  and because of our  internal engagement efforts,  EDEA  will make  new connections  to aerospace companies for the  College of Engineering and Architecture (CEA)  for student internships  and capstone projects . Another example of internal engagement benefiting the economic prosperity of  our  region  includes EDEA, Extension, Food Science, WSU  Extension Energy Office, WSU Composite  Materials and Engineering Center (CMEC), and CEA.

First, President  Floyd has committed  to a near doubling of support  to the efforts of the Office of  Commercialization to  grow  their staff, implement  management systems to increase technology  transfer, and support the necessary day -to-day increased functions of licensing. University  administration has also reorganized the SBDCs under EDEA to leverage engagement with small  business owners to increase job  creation and access to technical expertise  at WSU . Furthermore,  we have hired additional staff to support university corporate relations and will hire additional  staff in economic development to cover  more  areas of the state and industry sectors allowing  our  office to focus on increasing economic engagement efforts across the university. We have also  budgeted to hire information technology staff  in EDEA  to implement online tools  to input and  analyze  metrics  we will use  to drive  economic engagement  efforts  on campus, at the regional  campuses, and throughout the Extension network.   9,141(*1/%&/2%>1446/*3&(*1/   To obtain information from across the university on perception of economic engagement, the  CICEP Self -Assessment Survey  was distributed  in early 2013.

It was clear that  the number one way  WSU staff and faculty  receive  internal communications  is WSU News, a  daily online publication  distributed via email  communicating news about research and education achievements  including  outreach and  engagement . Second  were  the WSU Announcements and Washington State Magazine, a quarterly  publication  that  reaches nearly 160,000 readers around the world.  However, given the explosion  of social media outlets contributing to a wide variety of communication strategies in industry, we  were concerned  that  few of  our internal stakeholders cited  these  tools . The EDE A office  collaborated with Information Technology staff to stra tegize  and re -launch our online presence:  economicdevelopment.wsu.edu . In addition to the IT staff, we employed an external consulting  firm in the Puget Sound to help craft our messaging to spe ak to an external audience, highlighting  our research and education strengths and ability to partner for increased economic engagement.

aVFood Chain Safety:  Bringing Food Processing into the 21 st Century  www.fcsmats.com   Overview  Food Chain Safety (FCS) was founded at Washington State University (WSU) in 20 10 to maximize the  impact from over a decade of food sterilization research in the lab of Dr. Juming  Tang . Beginning  in  1999  with a grant from the US Army  and an industry consortium of US food producers, Dr. Tang began  a 10 -year journey  to develop a process  that could provide healthy, flavorful, and safe, foods to troops  worldwide.  This  new  sterilization process  uses  microwave  heating; a  new process  with  potential to  replace the standard  centuries -old process of \ufb01retorting\ufb02, or high -heat treatment  of foods wi th a  gentler heating process preserving foods\u2122 flavor, nutrition and texture better than traditional   sterilization . The resulting technology has been called \ufb01groundbreaking\ufb02, and \ufb01a tipping point  technology\ufb02  by major international food manufacturers , and i s on track to revolutionize the processed  food industry.    Background  Food and beverage production generated $850 billion in net sales in the United States in 2012. 1 Processed  food , a subset of the food and beverage production industry,  uses several  methods  of  sterilization  to  create  safe , read y-to-eat foods  for  consumer s. However,  while thermal retorting is the  current industry standard for sterilization,  retorting causes undesirable changes in the taste,  appearance, and nutritional value of the foods. Addi tionally, the high use of steam makes it one of the  most energy intensive operations in the food industry.    In an effort to produce foods of higher nutritional value and improved taste, while potentially lowering   the amount of energy needed to create these  products, the WSU -based lab of Dr. Tang began doing  research on the use of microwave radiation to sterilize foods. After several years of research Dr. Tang\u2122s   group was able to validate the use of 950Mhz microwave radiation to sterilize foods. This process  not  only uses less energy than the standard retort technique, it produces a food of superior quality in   almost every category: taste, appearance, and nutritional value.

aV Translational Research  As WSU Office of Commercialization began protecting and commercializing the intellectual property   generated by  Dr. Tang\u2122s research , the Washington State legislature launched an Entrepreneur in  Residence (EIR) program. After assessing many commercial ready technologies at WSU, Kevin Petersen   \u0152WSU\u2122s first EIR  \u0152 began working closely with Dr. Tang and his team in helping translate the re search  program into a robust, profitable, company.    To facilitate  the transition ,  several  food processing  industry -partners  invested  in FCS,  helping to  validate the work, give guidance on its development, and ensure the research was leading to a product  that would be accepted, and used, in the ir industry. Th is result ed in involvement of more than eight  private companies  including  Printpack, Silgan Plastics, Hormel, Ameriqual, Wornick, Natick Soldier  Systems (US ARMY), Kraft (formerly) and five other intern ational food manufacturing companies  partnering on  FCS\u2122  research and development  efforts. The result of these  collaborative  efforts  yielded  the first  MATS -B (Microwave Assisted Thermal Sterilization)  machine, below.  Additional R& D is ongoing  to continue to refine and improve on the technology.  Furthermore , other  uses  such as pasteurization  are being considered for the technology,  as well as applications  beyond the processed food industry.    MATS -B Machine built by WSU Researchers  and installed at a customer.    Economic Impact  Food Chain Safety\u2122s genesis was in a grant from the US Army for  $60,000 to explore radio frequency   sterilization . After  10  years of research and refinement  and nearly $4 million in federal follow on  funding , F CS was formed in  2010  and remains in Washington State. Over the past four years FCS has  raised over $3 million in private capital from more than eight corporate partners, coupled with $2   million in grants and gifts from public and private sources. They hav e employed 15 people (10 at WSU,  three at a subcontractor, and two at FCS)  and currently  support  10 students in Dr. Tang\u2122s lab . This  substantive, enduring, and meaningful economic impact came before the company had sold any   machines. Once manufacturing com es on -line in late 2013 or early 2014, these numbers will grow  significantly.

aVConclusion  In August 2012 Food Chain Safety\u2122s first commercial machine was sold to a customer and installed on -site at their facility. A second machine was sold in January 2013,  with a book of orders quickly  accumulating . The future of FCS continues to intrigue partner investors  who want a taste of the future  of processed food manufacturing. Furthermore, a  $5 million USDA/NIFA  grant to  FCS  has funded the  first generation  pasteurization hardware . The company and WSU are  keenly  aware that as adoption of  MATS  technology takes off, there will be an urgent need for a trained workforce to manufacture,  maintain, and operate the machinery. Discussions with local government and foo d processing  organizations have centered  on the creation  of a demonstration  and training center to support the  technology as well as create jobs and new business in the Northwest region.   This \ufb01tipping point\ufb02 technology is enabling healthier, better -tastin g versions of our favorite food  products and has major food producers cooking up new food items we\u2122ll soon see on shelves. Food   Chain Safety and WSU may soon be in every kitchen cupboard in the United States, and we\u2122ll all be   better off for it.   Food Chain  Safety as told by the CICEP New Metrics  1.

Throughout the process, it  became  apparent that no t only universities, but  federal agencies, and communities need to better measure and articulate the many ways in which  they  impact regional economies. This is no easy  task.  From our personal experience , one of the biggest challenges  was  collecting  measure s from  across  colleges and departments  and  communicating our impact with a number we could feel confident really captured the full impact, for instance, how many privat e entities sponsor  research at WSU . Centrally, metrics are collected to comply with fede ral and state regulations and those used to apply and re -apply for  university  classifications. However this central Office of Institutional Research was unable to obtain  some  of  New Metrics  20-priority m etrics  university  wide  for reasons stated above .   After much work to engage  the university broadly in this initiative  and making little progress , we have determined how to  more  slowly and  effectively integrate the metrics  at WSU  to obtain buy -in and create value in participation.  Two recent developments  have effected  this decision . There is a trend at universities across the country to create relationships with corporations with an investment mentality in  mind, r ather than a  philanthropic one, but universities have got to show value in investing, backed by  metrics. Simultaneously,  Washington State  Governors Office of  Aerospace is convening private business, public officials, and higher education to win the Boeing 777X as well as attract oth er aerospace  companies and suppliers to Washington State. More  frequ ently WSU ha s been  asked to provide information to the Governors Office in order to  make compelling cases to industry leads, and we have been unable to readily point to metrics that would inspire industry inve stment in our state.  The Corporate Relations o ffice, Economic Development, Government Affairs, and the College of Engineering will team up over the next several  months to collect metrics identified by CICEP New Metrics in order to assess  our contributions specific t o the aerospace industry. With this  set of  metrics in place that have been vetted locally and nationally, we should be able to create a compelling story of the many con tributions WSU makes  to aerospace  in research collaborations, unique basic research, student internships and job placement, and licensing opportunities to serve t he  industrys competitiveness  and growth .

The research based efforts lead to new  technologies, marketable products, company formation, and job creation. 2 These  unfunded designations of industry clusters within determined  geographical areas  directly benefit regional prosperity, as recognized by the Council of State Governments with the 2012 Innovation Award . Currently, there are 15  designated  IPZs, 7 of which Washington State University is a current partner, and three  that WSU is  in conversa tions  with  to become the higher education partner in  a designation or re -designation application. The IPZs, are managed by Economic Development  Councils, Ports, and other local economic development organizations,  but require  a higher education partner  as w ell as industry involvement  in the  organizational structure.  However, the outputs of IPZs have been varied and inconsistent, due to varied and inconsistent commitment by IPZ  partners.   Through the APLU Self -Assessment Survey,  it was  discovered there was no  mention of IPZs, leading us to conclude there is  ins ufficient internal  understanding of what an IPZ is or that  WSU has  formal partnership s with  several IPZs. Furthermore, individual interviews  with faculty and  administrators showed  there  remains  an appeti te for increased industry engagement, however there is a lack of bandwidth to pursue partnerships  and no clear roadmap for making long -term connections to regional industries.  Furthermore, as reported by the IPZ themselves, there is a lack of  understanding  of what their high education partners can do for industry and the local region.  Given the goals stated by the IPZ program, and WSUs desire to increase industry partnerships, this growth plan centers aroun d growing economic  engagement through stronger par tnerships with IPZs, accompanied by metrics that track research and education outputs made possible by IPZs.  This will be doable by fostering internal understanding of IPZ partnerships and the opportunities for engagement around the s tate thereby  increasin g university involvement towards a more competitive business climate.   These desired outcomes will require oversight by WSU Economic Development to ensure that areas of the university are adequate ly matched to  appropriate IPZs, and that the university rema ins responsive to the IPZ. Timely and substantive engagement will lead to mutual trust between  industries and WSU, resulting in engagement beyond the IPZ, including the ability to apply for large federal grants requiring  these relationships,  and matching f unds from industry.  If we are able to successfully increase  this  engagement  with IPZs, we anticipate industry will more readily seek  out WSU as a partner, whether or not related to an IPZ to access students as well as innovation.  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%=%9*2:,'7+('%;+*+4%./('(0,/%D(00,22,('J% :++3\u005c__888Q8*2+*12Q(17_&"cQ:+0 %*//4224-%d_?P_=>?@Q %

p3368
aV  1     (Word  count: 2572/25 00)   Introduction   Wayne State University (WSU)  is   a leader in     revitalization and  seeks to become the mo del  public research university engaged in the urban community. Whether by making financial investments,  creating new partnerships and programming, or using its power as a convener, WSU has demonstrated a  deep and abiding commitment to its neighborhood and  city. This application  lays out    increased economic engagement efforts over the last decade in the areas of place, business, and talent ,  along with e ncouraging results from these efforts.  I t  also highlights areas where the University has ro om  for growth  -   including better communication of its efforts to external and internal stakeholders and  creating a more supportive, inclusive culture for faculty to participate in these efforts     and charts  a   course for  achieving its potential .  WSU  is maki ng a profound impact  in  encouraging innovation and  economic prosperity in Detroit  and  the  region,  and  it  must  promote and share that work widely.
p3369
aVThe WSU IEP team  interpreted    innovation    as the process of  creating something new or using a new  approach t o solve  a n existing   challenge.   this   spirit  of innovation , whether  through t he   commercialization of new technology or bringing visionary thinkers to campus to explore  creative solutions to urban challenges through  events such as  th e Van Dusen Urban Leadership Forum.     is strongly influenced by t he Office of Economic   helping  build a dynamic, growing community full of opportunity for all.  Economic prosperity will be r ealized when  all parties

aVthe University, residents, businesses, community  organizations, government     benefit from the growing  number of  investments and opportunities in  Detroit. Through programs such as  Goldman Sachs  10,000 Small Businesses  (10KSB)  and  the  Live  Midtown residential incentive, WSU  strives   to ensure  the maximum number of  people benefit from  its   presence in Detroit.    
p3371
aV Process Experience   A   team of University faculty and staff was established  in January 2014  to pursue  the  IEP designation. The  team was  comprised of  Margaret E. Winters, Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs;  Ned Staebler, Vice President for Economic Development; Ahmad Ezzeddine, Associate Vice President for  Educational Outreach and Internatio nal Programs and Senior Associate to the President for Strategic   Planning & Special Initiatives; and Lisa Nuszkowski, Senior Project Administrator for Economic  Development.  The team  created and executed a five month plan for the self - study process , includi ng  a  pair  of  assessment   tools designed by the APLU.     Both assessments were  administered  using Qualtrics.  The WSU IEP team created lists of internal and  external  survey recipients  sc hools and colleges   and  relevant  administrati ve departments and offices . The external list was  comprised of contacts from local, regional, and state partners, including economic development  agencies; corporations; small businesses; entrepreneurship initiati ves; banks; investors; philanthropy;  and nonprofit organizations in Detroit with a role in community / economic development.
p3372
aVThe internal survey was sent to 125 recipients, and the external survey was sent to  about   1200  recipients.  Each was accompanied by   an introductory email and two reminder emails during the survey  period   and remained open for two weeks .  The response rate for each group was 44/125 (35%) and  123/1250   (10%) , respectively.  After the surveys were closed,   IEP team reviewed the response s  and identified  t wo  themes:    1.   Respondents to both survey s   generally thought that  each of the activit ies   were   important  to  the  University    
p3373
aV  3     2.   External respondents generally ranked WSU higher on each activity category; they gave more   than did internal respondents.
p3374
aVConcurrent with the IEP  self - study   process, WSU also reapplied for Community Engagement re - class  collect information for the Carnegie re - classification, and this input was compared  with IEP   survey   ed   the Univer  engagement.  Business engagement programs like Blackstone LaunchPad and 10 KSB ; increased public  safety   efforts ; partnerships with  other neighborhood  anchors  like  the Detroit Medical Center   and  Henry  Ford Health System ;   and overall increased level of engagement in the revitalization of Midtown were all  cited as strengths.  The  Carnegie  application also pointed to a lack of recognition/incentives for faculty  involvement in economic development activities; the University a   appears  to confirm this is a n area in which  WSU can improve  later in 2014 .
p3375
aV ,   while mechanisms were in  place to collect some of the data, additional work  must  be done to  gather complete and accurate  information. Because these metrics play such an important role i  economic impact (and sharing  that  story ), the WSU IEP team made this an action item under Objective  1.2 in its Growth/Improvement Plan.
p3376
aV  4     Summary of Accomplishments   &  Areas   for Improvement   WSU received high marks in  th e  category   ,  particularly   from  external respondents. Two activities in particular received high marks from both external and  internal stakeholders:  e mphasizing contributions to economic gro wth as  a   priorit y   (57 o f 65 external    and w orking alongside business and community leaders to identify  actionable economic growth priorities  (52 of 64    ) .   WSU    IEP team connected  favorable responses in this category with programs  and initiatives  that  k ey stakeholders  ident ified  as  important to economic advancement  in   the city and region ,   and  for  which the University has taken a  leadership role, including:  physical re development; attracting and retaining residents; providing a high  level of public safety; building and suppor  programs that attract, retain, and nurture talent.
p3377
aVResponses to the survey from both internal and external stakeholders made clear the areas that WSU  should target for improvement. Although s ome   ar eas , like the need for improved communication about  the   economic engagement work, were already   on the  University    it was helpful to  have this impression corroborated by survey feedback. While the WSU IEP team was not surprised that
p3378
aV   nearly half of internal  respondents (13 of 29) ranked WSU unfavorably, and these two  activities received the lowest ranking of  the internal survey.   Given that, it was not  unforeseen   that the third area for improvement was   p romoting openness, a ccessibil ity and responsiveness.    The biggest takeaway that the self - study  process produced is that while the University has become much more active in economic engagement  
p3379
aV  5     work over the last  decade , it  must  do a better job of  engaging more internal stakeholders and  communicating those effo rts both internally and externally. WSU is moving the needle in terms of  having an economic impact in the city and region, but it  must   promote and share that work more  widely.

aVincluding talent, facilities,  research, and land     to be a convener, partner, and catalyst for economic growth in Detroit, Sout heast  Michigan, and the state. The origins of this definition c o me  from  a vision established by former  President Irvin D. Reid (1997     2008), who envisioned  WSU  as  an economic driver for Detroit ,   as  engaged with redevelopment of the urban environment as it is with i ts core educational mission. Since  then, WSU  leadership ha s  grown increasingly focused on t he role  the University   can and should play in     , as  it emphasizes university - community collaboration;  research and   creative activity;  focus on   critical societal issues; and  contributions  to the public good.     Perhaps the most significant sign that this vision has infiltrated the DNA of WSU is the creation , by a  subsequent President,  of the Office of Economic Developmen t (OED), along with a Cabinet - level Vice  President position in 2011. Prior to  this , economic development functions were dispersed throughout  the University, with no single point of contact or o wnership. Today, the OED is home to  six   programs  and  19

As a major land  owner in Midtown, WSU  looks   for creati ve ways to increase available housing stock, not only for the  campus community, but the broader commun ity . In 2007, the University entered into its first ever  partnership with a private developer to build  S tudio One Apartments , the first phase of its  South  University Village plan . With 128 market - rate apartments and ground f loor retail on Woodward Avenue  just east of  WSU , Studio One  h elped  transform an underutilized asset   into new housing and retail for the   2008 Real Estate Development of the  Year  phase two of South University Village   at the corner of Cass Avenue and Canfield Street. When  completed in 2016, this nine - story ,   mixed - use development will offer nearly 250 u nits of market - rate  apartments , 19,000 square feet of retai l space, a hotel with capacity for 120 guests, and a conference  center that will accommodate up to 300 people.

Realizing a need to help forge connections between the University and industry, WSU established  The  Front Door  (TFD)  in 2009 . TFD was created not only  to address industry needs for access to university  resources,  but   also   for the University to seek and build partnerships  proactively  with businesses in the  areas of technology commercialization and sponsored research. Init ially, TFD was operated  with existing  staff   sponsored jointly by    ffice of the  Vice President for Research, Office of the Vice President for Economic Development and the Office of  the Vice Pres ident for Development and Alumni Affairs , and has a full - time director, relationship  manager, industry liaison with the Department of Engineering, and engagement specialist.  TFD has  s erved as the industry liaison and source of partners for two university - w ide grants totaling more than  $2 million   (BEST  -   $1.8M and BioNano  -   $250k). TFD staff has secured $610,000 in Small Company  Innovation Program funding and has awarded $370,000 in matching funds to   Michigan small businesses   to engage  with WSU  on company - specific research projects and  technology  development.   Since January  2013,  TFD has placed 23 student   interns  with small firms and is currently in discussions with Business  Leaders of Michigan & URC about funding and opportunities for more intern ship positions.

During the    two years of full -  transformation, each cohort of Fellows is nurtured through professional deve lopment that includes  executive -  b usiness and community   leaders .  The first cohort of DRFP fellows was launched in 2011 with 29 fellows.  Of the original fellows, 22 hav e stayed in Detroit.

aVReflections on accomplis hments   While the se accomplishments  reflect targeted  p lace,  business , and talent   strategies , they are also highly  interconnected and complementary of each other. By investing in place through real estate  development and providing an assurance of public safe ty, WSU seeks to attract and retain not only  talented students, faculty, and staff, but to create an environment conducive to new business.  Entrepreneurs  look  to locate their business in communities with a sense of place ,   alive  with people and  activity. He lping build the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Detroit through efforts such as the Blackstone  LaunchPad, TechTown, and 10KSB helps attract   and ret ain talent .  WSU  connect s   emerging  entrepreneurs with the resources needed to succeed so that they (and their business) stay in Detroit,  whether they are student s   who want to start their own business or faculty member s who want   to  commercialize a   discovery . While each accomplishme nt has a specific focus,  all    broader strategy to be at the heart of a vibrant, thriving neighborhood and city.
p3418
aV  19     There are several factors that have led to these accomplishments, the first being strong support from  University lea d ership.   For example, even though the cost of providing public safety services for Midtown  and its surrounding neighborhoods has increased and the University receives minimal external support  for WSUPD, it has continued to fully fund the department, as leadership  understands the importance of  a safe campus and community. The fact that these efforts have continued despite budget cuts from the   - term commitment to  the   neighborhood. Another key in  partners. The philanthropic community in particular has stepped up in a major way to support the   ; expanded  WSUPD public safety efforts; start - up and programming support for TechTown, The Front Door, 10 KSB ,  and Blackstone LaunchPad; and multi - year funding for  DRFP a nd  the  Van Dusen Urban Leadership  Forum. This continued financial support from partners   like the  Kresge Foundation,   Ford Foundation ,  New Economy Initiative ,  Hudson - We bber Foundation , and  Skillman Foundation , is a strong vote of  confidence that the University is focused on priorities critical to the regeneration of Detroit. The final  factor that has led to these  ac complishments i s the role of partnerships. None of these efforts have  been achieved by WSU alone. In fact, they are the result of bringing the right partners to the table and  working collaboratively to solve challenges  facing Detroit.  WSU has established itself as both a   leader  and a partner in these efforts.     There are several replicable strategies in the se   accomplishments. For example, the WSUPD Midtown  CompStat initiative has already expanded to at least two other neighborhoods in Detroit   that  are  working with the Detr  existing crime and develop proactive, data - driven responses to making their communities safer. The Live  Midtown residential incentive has been such a success that it has spurred  a second program, Live

The self - stu dy processed confirmed this hunch and has  provided OED with the ammunition needed to secure funding for a new position. The self - study process  was also useful in identifying specific areas where its communication can be improved, particularly with  its inte rnal stakeholders. Over the next 12 months, the OED will  reach out to individual schools, colleges,  and departments to arrange for opportunities to give presentations, talks, informal brown bag lunches,  etc. to faculty and staff to discuss who the OED is,  its work, and opportunities to include the

Implementing efficient procedures for  securing contracts, licenses, and other agreements with industry.   Effective engagement and long term collaboration between faculty and industry requires knowledge and  understanding of expectations of industry partners. Industry collaborations are also beco ming key  components of federal funding initiatives. However, the cultures of academic and  industry differ  significantly.  In order to capitalize on the benefits of such partnerships WSU  will  provide informational     to encom pass all aspects of the collaborations including roles and  responsibilities in research; milestones   and deliverables; contractual   and legal considerations  and   best   pr actices for engaging industry.
p3430
aV To  increas e  industry - university partnerships at WSU,  the  University will need to explore  modify ing   its  approach to industry contracts to ensure that they are more  industry - friendly ; contract  turn - around  time  is decreased;  and  s tandardized contracts and consistent terms for testing and services   are  established .  S pecifically, WSU  should consider the following:     1.   Adopting URC partner university practices that are not currently used at WSU . The  URC  promote s   industry - friendly tools that are   n o t   yet   employed at WSU .  Discrepancies should be identified and  addressed s o as not to  mislead  potential  industry   partners about the process, especially where  sponsored research agreements and contracts are concerned.

Georgia Tech has streamlined  its  contract   process with straightforward intellectual  property terms for companies engaging in coll aborative research based on the stage of the research or  work to be completed at the university. While each final agreement may be customized to meet the  needs of both parties, they start from a contract better suited for the extent of research (and likeli hood  of  intellectual property   generation) using the following four contracting mechanisms:

Georgia Tech defines a fee to  gain  access to  intellectual property   generated, outlines licensing rights , etc. Many companies  prefer pre - defined intellectual property  and licensing terms  prior to  agree ing   to sponsor   university  research. WSU often resists negotiating terms for access to  intellectual pr operty  generated in a project ahead of time and   when it does, i t takes a long time to modify  the  agreement to do so.

aV Educating fac ulty regarding opportunities and benefits related to participation in regional economic  development activities.    The Office of the Provost and the Office of the Vice President for Research sponsor a series of  Professional and Academic Development workshops   each semester; participation in economic  development is a very appropriate topic and will be  recommended to the organizers.  In addition, the  Vice President for Economic Development, perhaps in collaboration with the School of Business  Administration and/o r the  Associate  Vice President for Educational Outreach and International  Programs, could develop targeted workshops, a website with information and resources (with the  necessary publicity to make its existence well known), and an electronic newsletter as  other ways to  make regional economic development better known to a wider range of faculty and staff.     Promoting openness, accessibility and responsiveness   Maintaining user - friendly portals and websites to search for faculty and staff expertise and R&D  facilities.    President for Research, teamed up with the University Research Corridor (URC) and the Michigan  Corporate Relations Network (MCRN) to create and  be a part of a statewide University Expertise  Portal.     The  Expertise Portal   is a way  for businesses to search for the resources they need and see  which  universities have experts and facilit ies to meet their needs.   The Expertise Portal is a relatively new  resource that provides users with a comprehensive view of faculty publications, grants, patents and  research collaborators, as well as   a   listing of physical resources available (e.g. core la bs). As a unique,

TFD   is proud to be a part of the Detroit BizGrid which showcases over 54  busin ess service providers who are key actors in the Detroit region.     Additionally,  TFD   created and  hosted BizGrid Live! ,    an effort to create collaboration between the community as w ell as with companies needing their  services to grow and thrive.

aVWSU  should pursue more opportunities for collaboration with existing busines s groups such as Business  Leaders for Michigan and the Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce. While WSU already has

aV Over the pa st 135 years, Western University   has assumed a preeminent role in   learning.  Western is widely recognized for its achievements across an  impressive spectrum of academic, research, commercialization and community - b uilding endeavours, and routinely ranks highest among its peers as offering the  best student experience in the country.
p3449
aVIn 2014, Western released the latest version of i ts Strategic Plan   entitled:   2 .   The Plan, which encompasses a  broad range of initiatives designed to enhance and advance the ac ademic,  research and community - based mission of the University, also includes an  elevated commitment to innovation and economic prosperity beyond the  institutio  already noteworthy accomplishments in this area.
p3450
aV In fact, Western  recognizes the importance of its role   beyond pure academia and  research.  It recognizes that it must also act as   a catalyst for ideas, innovation,  wealth - creation and social good   at the local, regional and national level 3 .    Therefore it should not be surprising that Western   is extremely proud of its  contribu tion to the  well being of its home region and global constituents.  It is a  commitment that it expects to continue, and a co ntribution that it now seeks to  e xpand and amplify in the years to come.
p3451
aV    2   For an online link to the Strategic Plan, please see  http://president.uwo.ca/strategic_planning/index.html     3   Western leaders share the perspectives outlined in the Carnegie Engagement Classification and Kellogg  Commission on Engagement and  have been strong advocates of such a role among their peers across  Canada.  The University is also working to emulate those practices established by those US - based  counterparts that have already secured the IEP Designation.  This is the principal reason wh y Western is  now seeking to become one of the first Canadian universities to secure this distinction.   
p3452
aV    4   To this end, Western embedded a number of key economic and societal prioriti es   into   it s Strategic Plan.  They include :
p3453
aV-   A commitment to community leadership and investment.   -   A commit ment to community accessibility, interaction and engagement.   -   A commitment to local innovation and wealth creation.   -   A commitment to  creating a greater   regional profile and  more civic  pride.   Commensurate with the launch of its Strategic Plan   in the Spring 20 14   and  subsequent  initiation of this application process, Wester n  undertook a  comprehensive review   of its  quantifiable economic and social contribution to  the  region .  It also surveyed a number of external stakeholders to garner their  perspective of the Un iversity and   better   understand   its  perceived value  to the  community. This external  review was then supplemented wi th a more recent  online survey   of its campus - based stakeholders to determine how important   e  University was delivering upon   t hem.  In effect, the interviews and surveys    bution to - date and identify  opportunities for future growth and development.   Western is pleased to submit this   Application seeking one of the first  APLU  Innovation and Economic Pr osperity Designations ever awarded to an institution  in Canada.  In the pages   that follow, Western   is pleased to share wit h the CICEP    deserving of such a designation ,   and what the University plans to do in the coming years to further enhance its  role as a n   innovator   and economic con tributor to the community .     Western is very proud to be building on its leadership role in this increasingly  important area ,   and is privileged to be submitting this Application on behalf of its  const ituents across campus and throughout its   community.     Proc ess Experience     Concurrent with the launch of its Strategic Plan, Western developed a series of  performance objectives  and   metric s 4   linked to  the  strategic priorities outlined  above   to   aid the University in the analysis and  a chievement of these priorities   and the ir   intended economic and social impacts. These included the following;     1.   Incre ase International student enroll ment and engagement.    2.   Increase experiential learning opportunities for students that transfer well to  the economy and society .

aV  4    priorities and applied them where releva  measured in part through the number of new applied research projects acquired and the dollar value of that research.
p3455
aV    5   3.   Increase   graduate enrol l ment  with an emphasis on knowledge creation and  application .    4.   Improve   accessibility and success in higher education for Indigenous peoples.    5.   Increase focus on research outcomes.   6.
p3456
aVWestern then und ertook a three - pronged approach to   benchm ark    current economic   and social contr ibution.     First, Western   established a   cross - campus team  that included senior  representatives from the Offices of the President, Provost   &   Vice President  (Academic) , Research, Government Relations, Communications, Finance and  Business Development.  This team was charged with coordinating the evaluation  process, engaging key internal and external stakeholders, compiling and  publishing the res ults, and identifying opportunities for growth and areas of  improvement.     Second, Western engaged a professional accounting firm 5   to assist it with the   locally, regional ly , and   nationally.
p3457
aV Third,  Wester n conducted a series of internal and external stakeholder interviews  to capture their ideas and secure their support.  Meetings were held with all 11  F aculties at Western that included faculty   leaders , researchers, graduate and  undergraduate students and staff members.    Western also met internally with  staff associations, Western University Student    Council   (USC) , Professional  Management Association, faculty union associations, staff union associations  and support personnel.    Ex ternal stakeholder engagement included    three Affiliates , The   City of London, the  Chamber of Commerce, London  Economic Development Corporation, TechAlliance ,   Middlesex County,  the  Federal and Provincial Government, Members of Parliament ,  existing  industry  partners and over 25   companies from around the region .     Western supplemente d this interview process with   online survey s 6   derived from  samples provided th rough the  CICEP  portfolio of Assessment Tools .  The  surveys were  direc ted t o key constituents  to confirm the interview findings .     As a result of this  process , Western is   able to   clearly   articulate   its  economic  development   and societal contribution at a local, regional and n ational level , an  estimate that collectively exceeds $ 11. 3   Billion annually ,   including $3.6 Billion  annually in the City of London alone .
p3458
aV    6   Western also has  a much better understanding  of its perceived value to the  region and  the areas where it can improve and even   expand its economic  contribution .  These areas include :
p3459
aV 1.    - campus Entrepreneurial Ecosystem,    2.   supporting faculty and students in the pursuit of more Research,  Development & Commercialization ( RD&C) opportunities, and ,     3.   better focusing   the Universit    economic development resources on those  fields of study where Western researchers can offer the  commercial  market a  distinct com petitive advantage and serve as   a magnet for outside industry  and investment.
p3460
aV  The   applied research strengths   Western has identified as a result of this process  are  i n life and health sciences , engineering, environmental sciences and  business.  In the sections t hat follow,   Western is pleased to share w ith the  Commission, its current understanding of the   Economi c Engagement Enterprise  and its Economic Engagement Plan   for   the future.     The Economic Engagement Enterprise     Western  minds seeking the best learning experience at a leading Canadian research  university.    Its mission , in part,   is to create, disseminate and apply knowledge for  the benefit   of society.   The University seeks to continue to build upon its long - standing legacy of exceptional scholarship, social advancement and innovation.
p3461
aV  Therefore it is not surprising that West  boast o f a number of noteworthy contributions , including economic ones  at a  local, provincial   and national level. For one, according to Weste  Impact Report 7   r ecently completed by an independent  accounti ng firm, the  U niversity can confidently point   to   the following   economic contributions :

p3469
aVOver the past five years, Western leadership has also begun to invest  consider able time and resources towards a number of  broader  community  endeavours.  For example, Weste rn executives are active members of   several  regional economic deve lopment Board and Commissions.  Western  administrative and faculty leaders routinely participate in economic development  initiatives at the regional,  provincial and national level. They have also led  several economic development programs including the creation of a new  citywide   medical innovation network and the  recruitment of a number of new businesses  to the area that might  have  not invest ed in London   if not for their desire   to locate   home to 85 such companies ranging from multinational corporations, to  universit y - driven spin - off companies, to  entrepreneur - driven technolog y start - up  entities.     Western has learned through this review process that there are a number of  areas on which it could improve and   support greater prosperity   and innovation   in  the region . These include:
p3470
aV   better educating student and faculty on   the possi bilities  and potential  of  applied research partnerships, invention, commercialization,   and most notably  entrepreneur ship;
p3471
aVincreasing the number of experiential learning opportunities fo r its student  through co - ops,   internships   and start - up companies ;

p3476
aV    8   also help the Institution r ealize a number of its   strategic priorities.    To this end,  Wester n leaders have elected to direct a number of its  resources 9   on  the  three  near - term initiatives   of greatest impact and immed iate benefit to the London  r egion . They are   captured and described further under each of the following three  categories :     1.  Strengthen    s Entrepreneurial   Eco - System     Western plans   to further develop and deploy a campus - wide entrepreneurship  program that crosses faculties and fields of study.     This includes establishing a  center   for student entrepreneurship in the heart of the campus making it  convenient for students, faculty and s taff to explore the prospects of  entrepreneurship.  This orientation and assimilation process will  also  stimulate  business development and provide clients with valuable skills that  they  might not  otherwise acquire through traditional non - business curriculu ms.
p3477
aVIn addition, a   number of key  regional  economic sectors requiring talent and  available  employment for students  were identified including ,   advanced  manufacturing, financial services, digital media, life sciences, health services,  agri - foo d,   engineering   and education services.    Western needs to c reate  much  more  opportunities for student pl acement, co - ops and internship programs  designed to give students   (including those disadvantaged due to economic  means)   the experience needed to make a more pronounced  impact in the region.
p3478
aV 2. Aggressively Pursue M ore RD& C   Opportunities in the Region     Western is increasingly becoming an economic magnet to the region.  T he  process experience highlighted the impact of Western in working with various  companies and organiz ations. Many of the external partners were able to  quantify the direct effect of Western on their business, and also identify how  Western could further improve their   capabilities through academic - industry  partnerships and the shared pursuit of   new commercial market   opportunities.   In  addition   to greater a ccess to    can do more to facilitate this process and share its knowledge asse ts with the  broader market.     3.

Promotion and Communication s     Western is keen   to share its  past  track record   and future plans   of economic and  social engagement with constituents throughout the region.  To th is end, the  University has already begun an awareness - building process by releasing the  highlig hts of its Economic Impact Report .  The summary results, which have  been listed    value to its campus, its community and the nation.
p3481
aVThe awareness plan is targeted to specific constituent groups, each seeking to  engage the University in a more pronounced economic develo pment effort.  The  groups include:
p3482
aVTrade Commissions, U niversit y and  Industry Partners     For example, Western   is  one of the founding members of the Global Business  Opportunity Council (GBOC) in partnership with the Lo ndon Chamber of  Commerce . The GBOC Committee's goal is to facilitate export and foreign direct  investment opportunities   in the  London   region.    Th e success of the program has  le d to a number of focus committees for Asia, Latin America, Brazil and Europe.  Western is   also   developing many additional international agreements and  opportunities for attract ing foreign students, researchers and partners to Western  and  London. These partnerships and   agreements are allowing London  companies to develop new export mar kets and   distribution partners ,   and create  strong employment opportunities in London .

aVA more de tailed descript ion   of  these initiatives   complete with timing,   applicable me asure s and the resources  allocated to this portion of the Plan   can be found in Appendix B .     Advancing University Economic Engagement     Over the past decade, Canadian universities  have been confronted with a  number of challenges, including the need to offer exceptional programs and  service s through   ever dwindling resources.  In response, Canadian universities

p3487
aVWestern also hopes to introduce the program   to its Affiliates and Community  College partners.  In fact, one College has already completed a similar   assessment of  its   regional economic impact.  Western is convinced that a broad  application of the practices outlined i n this process will   heighten over all  awareness  of   the value of public institutions  with in the   Canadian   economy and     community.

aV  Western has   begun to tackle   th is problem by   dev eloping research infrastructure  that can function at a scale relevant to the needs of our industry partners,  government agencies, and  other stakeholders.  The three  projects   described  below   exemplify this approach 11 .     The London Wastewater Facility     As a  founding member of the Southern Ontario Water Consortium  (SOWC), Western worked closely with private sector partners in the water  treatment industry and the City of Lo ndon to develop a world - class  research  facility (operating inside an existing municipal w aste water  treatment plant) allowing   industry partners to develop, validate, and  demonstrate new technologies at full scale. The  3,000sf. lab   is currently  operational with industry tenants pursuing collaborative research and  development with academics from     of Engineering, to  develop, integrate  and commercialize new wastewater treatment systems.

aV  The  WindEEE Dome   Building on over 50 years of experience in wind engineering, Western  identified the need to test buildings and other structures  in non - standard  wind patterns, including tornadoes and downbursts. Working with leading  engineering and wind tunnel design firms, Western developed t he concept
p3493
aV    12   and secured over $30   M illion in funding from  internal sources and  the  Federal and Provincial  governments   to construct the Wind Engineering,  Energy and Environment (WindEEE) Dome    testing facility .    This capability has provided significant additional value to  our industry partners in the civil engineering, architectural, an d insurance  industries. Partners can test new designs for building structures, building  materials and building techniques, as well as renewable energy systems  such as wind turbines, at relevant model scales, using the latest  experimental techniques.     The F rau nhofer Project  Center   @ Western     Western has established a partnership with the Fraunhofer Institute of  Chemical Technology (ICT) based in Pfinztal, Germany. This successful  partnership has resulted in the first Fraunhofer Project  Center   in   Canada,  a 10,000s f. state - of - the - art industrial facility  equipped with a 2,500 tonne  industrial hydraulic press and five different manufacturing processes  all  focused on developing advanced polymer composite materials and  processes to serve the  global  aut omotive, transportation ,   and   construction  markets . This  $28 M illion  project   was a co - investment by Western,  t he  City of London  and the Federal  government . The facility has already  completed more than 25 collaborative research projects with   private - sector p artners collectively  value d  at  more than $3   M illion dollars. These  projects typically involve a team consisting of industry partner R&D  experts, Fraunhofer Project  Center   research engineers and technicians,  and students from Western and other institutions.
p3494
aV In each case,  Western consulted extensively with partners and potential users of  each of these facilities, to validate customer demand and to guide the de sign and  implementation of the new  facility.  The facilities also better acclimate students to  the i ndustrial technology platforms and real - world RD&C scenarios.   The  infrastructure also   serves  as a magnet   to attract and retain industry partners in  the city, and enable new companies to develop, demonstrate, validate and  commercialize new technology.     Each of these above  projects provided a numbe r of  project - specific lessons   and   shared two common features.     1.   Good project management practices are essential when delivering a project  with a fixed budget and a fixed deadline.  Assigning a project lead with o verall  responsibility for the project, and for liaising with funding stakeholders is  crucial to success.   2.   Building the business plan and business process is as important as building  the physical infrastructure. All three of t hese projects were implemented w ith  this point in mind.   Given the size and value of these facilities, a ll projects of  this nature have a business plan that is reviewed with senior university  leadershi p   before   a proposal is released to the funding agency.

aV   II.   Enhanced  Commercialization   Capacity     Western recognizes that innovation leads to prosperity. London and the  surroundin g region   have experienced significant change and economic instability  with the changing face of industry and manufacturing since 2008.    In an effort t o  meet that  challenge, Western, in partnership with its two research hospitals  combined their resources to create   a  shared technology transfer and  commercialization organization   called WORLDiscoveries .  Since its inception,  WORLDiscoveries has established a measurable  and impressive track record of  success, including:
p3496
aV  routinely ranking among the top five income generating techno logy transfer  offices in Canada;
p3497
aVleading the nation for three successive years in the number of   new spin - off  companies created;
p3498
aVestablishing th e first  permanent  Canadian technology transfer office in Asia.     In the latter case, it is worth noting that Western has since expanded its Asian  footprint by adding offices in Nanjing, Hong Kong, and Tanjin, China .   This   commitment has resulted in matching investments by Chinese public sector and  industrial partners and  paved the way for further technology transfer, licensing,  and commercialization activities that WORLDiscoveries is pursuing actively  throughout the Pacifi c Rim .     Since its inception, Western has secured 12 revenue - generating agreements  with Asian - based indus try partners valued at over $6 M illion to - date, and formed  the first two joint venture companies ever in Canada between a Chinese  multinational and two  university - based spin - offs.     Analyzing the innovation pipeline, WORLDiscoveries has determined that it will  need to cast a wider net outside of the original institutional members to recognize  the potential of innovations and other intellectual capital that   is available  throughout the region. A further key lesson, on the demand side of technology  transfer, is to look more broadly for opportunities outside the conventional   technology transf er activities.     III.   Expanded  Research   Opportunities   Through Partnerships     Building partnerships has been an important success factor   to Western research .    Western has enjoyed increasing success securing applied and contract research  opportunities through a  preferred roster of industry partners, all of w hom consider  Western research to be   a valuable ally in their pursuit of new commercial

aV    14   markets.  In addition to self - financing research, these projects serve as excellent  training opportunities for Western stu dents and portals to future employment.  Unfortunately, these applied research projects are largely limited to a few key  industry partners and a select few faculti es.  Western now need s to expand its  market reach   in select, targeted  fields of study that bet ter match   the capabilities  of the university with  the needs o f the region.
p3500
aVAs     relationship with  all three levels of government has  been  to  vital to  building sustainable partnerships in the community.    In fact,   the  City of London  has served as a critical enabler to many projects. For example,  in  addition to the civic investments outlined above , Western can measure success  by enumerating the following City investments:

p3502
aVsecuring   $10 M illion to kick - start the development of a new   Medical  Innovation Network   to commercialize emerging medical device technology.     Western needs to continue to foster these public   sector partnerships and direct  these investments towards even greater  regional prosperity and social  advancement.

aVO n - Campus Entrepreneurial Ecosystem   While Western has done an exemplary job moving inventions and innovations to  market, the number of faculty   members and students  who are aware of and  electing to avail themselves   of the University    entrepreneurial  business  development services is still quite small .  This is due in large measure to a  number of cultural and  structural weaknesses on  campus, including:     -   a strong   historical   bias towards basic research and pure academic pursuits;   -    technology transfer services relative to  the  campus core;    -   limited understanding of th e full range of complimentary business  development services available to faculty members and students alike;   -   limited recognition for faculty and students  that choose to pursue innovative  or entrepreneurial endeavours.   In an effort to   combat this inertia an d expand   its effectiveness in this area,  Western plans to undertake a number of initiatives designed to raise awareness  about the possibilities and potential of innovation, commercialization and  entrepreneurship.  Specifically, Western seeks to dramaticall y increase the  awareness among faculty, staff and students of the business development  support programs available to its campus community   through   a notable increase  in awareness generating initiatives, including:
p3513
aVFun and Lunch  orientations sessions .     It also seeks to invest aggressively in the deployment  of  a much more  visible   on - campus entrepreneurship  presence  designed to reach faculty a nd students in  academic   fields of study   not normally associated with entrepreneur ship such as  the Arts and Music.  The obje ctive of this new , dedicated   on - campus  entrepreneurship facility    internal audience with the prospe cts and potenti al of business development ,   while  affording these   same   stakeholders with an opportunity to  conveniently  explore   the world of   entrepreneurship and apply it to their research, personal  development,  career  and/or academic pursuits as needed.

The new policy, entitled   - C hoice    replaces the   - Owned IP approach with a much more   empowering version that allows   research ers and students  to retain full ownership     view that such a progressive approach will  motivate its on - campus community to explore opportunities to commercialize  products and processes , or start a new business.   Western will  also  invest the incremental resources required to increase the  number of Wo rk Integrated Learning Experiences and international learning  opportunities available so that any academically eligible student wishing to  participate in such learning experiences will have opportunity to do so.     Western is  also  home to approximately 450 s tudents who identify themselves as  being of Aboriginal ancestry and whose presence and activities contribute  significantly to the cultural diversity of our campus community. Looking ahead,  Western reaffirms its commitments to making higher education more a ccessible  to Indigenous peoples, to improving the learning experiences and success of  Indigenous students, to hiring and supporting the success of Indigenous scholars  and staff, and to improving the well - being of Indigenous peoples through ethical  research   and social involvement.    Western also needs to  further  augment its business  support services to ensure  that  prospective  entrepreneurs have access to  the tools and talent   they need to  succeed.  This includes securing additional incubation and acceleration  space  and services, matching top   researchers with new business graduates, in creasing  the available amount    Fund, and engaging more local mentors to invest their time and money into  University - bred  commercial opportunities.   Finally, Western can   do a much better job recognizing and rewarding those  innovators on campus that have do exhibit a strong commercial or  entrepreneurial bias towards their research and their  teachings.  Western  benefits from   a s trong network of market - bias researchers and students that  have transformed that interest into considerable commercial and societal  success.  In addition to augmenting their own lab resources through the return  from their inventions, their work has stimula ted advances across a range of new  product ideas and innovations that have enhanced the quality of life for citizens  both locally and around the world.    While the number of researchers now     has incr eased  considerably over the past decade , Western can do a better job of celebrating  past successes and in doing   so , motivate others   to consider applied research  and entrepreneurial endeavours.

This   manufacturing and agriculture sectors, many of  which might   benefit from   business co nsulting,  product development, process  improvement, testing, and validation capabilities.   In an effort to help better acquaint regional industry with this capacity, Western  plan s   to engage the market through a number of venues including:   -   Hosting Industry S ymposiums and Sector - specific Open Houses   -   Association membership and participation   -   Expanding its business school consulting services   -   Recruiting Alumni to assist with introductions and outreach   Western will also examine and amend its Intellectual Property p olicy to provide  industry with more retention options should the applied research   contracts   result  in new products and processes.  Western is increasingly of the view that such  innovations, whether developed in - house or in - partnership with a regional  indus try p artner ,   can   enrich the community much more through incre ased  commerce and job prospects tha n they might     portfolio   of   shelved   products and  dormant  patents .     Wester n will also seek to amplify   its  regional  econ omic development   message  through a more focused    approach that emphasizes the  potential competitive advantage of working with the University and the potential  talent pool available to local  commercial interests.

aVWestern also plans to a     to utilize their resources   .   In  addition to stimulating applied research opportunities and the i nnovations that  might arise from such collaborative work, this targeted outreach to regional   talent retention and job creation.   Focus on Strategic Areas of  Research   Strength   Western   leader s   acknowledge that while the University is strong in a number of     may be better   served by  foc    fields of study where the Institution can make  an immediate and   material economic and social impact in the region   and   where it  holds a comparative advantage, namely medicine and advanced manufacturing.   
p3518
aV    19   Specifically, Western is seeking to dramatically expand its role in the    manufacturing sector.   In regards to the former,  Western can boast of a long and  impressive legacy in the medical field , particularly in the area of diagnostics and  musculoskeletal   (MSK)   health.  Western has also made several noteworthy  contributions to the manufacturing sector, with emphasis on the application and  use of lightweight materials, robotics   and bio - industrial   products and  processes.    To this end, Western has established a joi nt venture partnership between the   medical innovation and commercialization network for the region.  This new  network, which will be modeled after similar team - based initiatives f ound in the  United States, is designed to bring researchers, entrepreneurs and industry all  under one roof and all dedicated to designing, developing, testing and validating   - related  challeng es.     In a similar vein, Western has established a joint venture partnership with the   ty Colleges to design, develop and deploy   new   products  and processes in the lightweight materials and bio - industrial fields.  The   strengths in processing and technical application to create   these promising   synergistic, cross - lea rning opportunities.   Western and its College partners have  already secured financial support from federal, provincial and civic resources and  can proudly point to a number of exciting job creation and wealth creation  initiatives through this targeted app roach.
p3519
aVThe Institutions now need to expand   growing roster of international partners.   Overall, Western is excited by the potential of these initiatives and looks forward  to e xpanding upon both its current success and promising future.
