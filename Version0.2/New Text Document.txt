First of all the project or the code is for text summarization.
It gives us a small summary of a whole article or script which includes all the
important points from the script.

We can perform text summarization in two ways.
1] Extraction based summarization

-The extractive text summarization technique involves pulling keyphrases from
the source document and combining them to make a summary.

-In this project Lexrank using summy,LSA(latent sqmantic analysis) using summy
 and Luhn algorithm using summy are used along with Textrank method using
 gensim is used for extraction based summarization.

2] Abstraction based summarization 

-The abstraction technique entails paraphrasing and shortening parts of the 
 source document. When abstraction is applied for text summarization in deep 
 learning problems, it can overcome the grammar inconsistencies of the 
 extractive method.

-The abstractive text summarization algorithms create new phrases and 
 sentences that relay the most useful information from the original 
 text just like humans do.

-In this project the Textsum files which contains the neural network
 models and seq2seq models are used to create Abstraction based summarization.
