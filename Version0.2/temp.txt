The purpose of the self-study was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of Georgia Tech s engagement in regional economic growth and prosperity and identify opportunities for increased engagement and impact.  Key steps in the self-study included conducting a survey of Georgia Tech s internal and external stakeholders, collecting key economic development metrics, and comparing current economic development strategies in the context of Georgia Tech s strategic plan.  The assessment findings were presented at a feedback forum attended by both internal and external stakeholders.  Together, all of the activities of the self-study helped to identify areas for improvement and to develop a plan of action.   Since its founding in 1885, innovation and economic development have been integral to the mission of Georgia Tech, and its strategic plans.  Georgia Tech s motto of  Progress and Service  has been embraced throughout its history and has resulted in a continuing culture that supports innovation, entrepreneurship and public service.   The Institute s 25-year strategic plan,  Designing the Future,  adopted in 2010, clearly states this commitment.     As envisioned by our founders, Georgia Tech will continue to be an economic driver for Atlanta, the state of Georgia, and the nation . . . But our scope and impact will extend worldwide as well. Georgia Tech will take the lead in creating a climate that not only celebrates basic research and scholarship, but also where research yields practical applications and where national and international collaborations yield commercial successes. We will create a culture where students and faculty are both scholars and entrepreneurs.  2  \x0c  Georgia Tech President G.P. Bud  Peterson, assigned responsibility for the IEP assessment and designation application to the Enterprise Innovation Institute (EI2), Georgia Tech s primary economic development organization.   In January 2014, an application team led by Chris Downing, Associate Vice President, EI2, was assembled and included members from a broad spectrum of Georgia Tech units including staff from the Office of the Executive Vice President for Research (EVPR), Enterprise Innovation Institute, the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI), Georgia Tech Communications and Georgia Tech Professional Education (GTPE).     Georgia Tech s team completed the assessment process by focusing on the two fundamental concepts of the IEP Designation: Innovation and Economic Prosperity.   For this application, these concepts were defined/interpreted as follows:  Cross-functional Team from Across Georgia Tech: Chris Downing -EI2, Co-lead Juli Golemi - EI2, Co-lead Bill Cutts - GTRI Greg King - USG & EI2 \nMark Weston   GTPE Kirk Englehardt - GT Communications Jan Youtie - EI2 Shabana Figueroa   GTPE Carl Rust - EVPR Lynne Henkiel - EI2 Innovation   Innovation is the process of moving ideas, invention, and technology toward meaningful use in society.   Economic Prosperity   Driving economic development through a wide range of activities including education, workforce development, entrepreneurship, technology commercialization, and direct outreach services to businesses and communities.     1.2 Process Experience As part of the self-study process, the application team embarked on the institutional assessment that included:    Reviewing the Georgia Tech Strategic Plan as it relates to economic development    Reviewing current Georgia Tech programs in economic development    Collecting key economic impact metrics across campus units    Constructing and conducting a survey of internal and external stakeholders    Hosting a feedback forum with stakeholders  3  \x0c    Develop an improvement plan   \n1.2.1 Based on review of the Georgia Tech strategic plan and current programs in economic Internal and external surveys  development, the application team developed a survey based on the APLU survey tool. The modified version included questions that more closely reflect Georgia Tech s strategic plan.  The survey was sent to approximately 550 internal stakeholders including research faculty, administrators, economic development practitioners, and incubator staff.   The survey was also sent to approximately 2,500 external stakeholders including clients from our outreach programs, the Georgia Economic Developers Association, the Metro Atlanta Chamber, and the Georgia Economic Development Department.  The response rate from the internal survey was 36% (195 responses), and 16% (377 responses) for the external survey.   The type of respondents was also broad as shown in Figures 1 and 2.  Each survey was comprised of nine questions, plus sub-questions that assessed Georgia Tech s performance in economic development. (See Appendix.)   Survey Outcomes Survey findings indicated that Georgia Tech is actively engaged in economic development by internal and external stakeholders.  91% of the external survey responders and 90% of the internal responders indicated that Georgia Tech s contribution to  Economic Development and Innovation Economy  is important or very important.  And, that Georgia Tech is doing a good job in its economic development  4  \x0c efforts, but room for improvement exists.  Communication of Contributions, Successes and Achievements  was identified as needs improvement.  93% of the external responders stated this was important or very important. However, only 54% rated performance as good or very good.       88% of the external stakeholders thought that  Openness, Accessibility and Responsiveness  was important or very important, but only 35% of the responders thought Georgia Tech was doing a great job in this area.  Survey results indicated that Georgia Tech is doing a good job of  Working Alongside Business/Government/Community Leaders to Identify Actionable Economic Growth Priorities  with a score of nearly 4 out of 5 from external stakeholders.  The feedback forum identified an opportunity to increase the interaction of the economic partners especially those located at Georgia Tech s Technology Square.      1.2.2 Metrics  The team reviewed Georgia Tech s programs and utilized 12 key economic development and innovation metrics recommended by APLU.  These metrics represent a broad set of Georgia Tech s activities which are summarized in Figure 3.  Data for these metrics was collected for the most recent fiscal year completed (Fiscal Year 2013, ending June 30, 2013), and include historical results Figure 3.

(See Appendix.)   \n1.2.3 Stakeholder Engagement The application team conducted a feedback session with key internal and external stakeholders on April 8, 2014.  Nearly 45 participants, including regional economic developers and leaders, external business and industry clients, Georgia Tech extension staff, researchers, and academic staff, attended the session.  The purpose of the feedback session was to present the survey results, metrics, organizational structure, and to engage our stakeholders for in-person feedback on future directions for Georgia Tech s economic engagement efforts.   Mr. Downing, Associate Vice President, Enterprise Innovation Institute (EI2) and team co-leader opened the session by providing an overview of the IEP designation and the self-study process. Stephen Fleming, Georgia Tech Vice President and Executive Director of the Enterprise Innovation Institute, provided a summary of Georgia Tech and EI2 s economic development efforts.   A summary of the key metrics was presented by Mr. Downing.  Juli Golemi, team co-leader, followed with the presentation and interpretation of survey findings.  To gain stakeholder feedback, small group discussion sessions were then conducted on three main questions that arose from the surveys: 1)  How can Georgia Tech better communicate its role and successes in economic development and regional engagement?  2)  Today, most of Georgia Tech s economic develop efforts focus on technology commercialization, entrepreneurship and startup development, and industry & business assistance.  What other areas should GT consider?    3)  How can Georgia Tech be a better partner and collaborator on your economic development efforts? Insights gained during the feedback session provided valuable input for developing a plan of action to grow and improve economic engagement.     6  \x0c  \n 1.3  The Economic Engagement Enterprise Commitment to economic engagement is threaded throughout Georgia Tech s current Strategic Plan,  Designing the Future,  and includes engagement of the entire Georgia Tech community with the broader society1.  For example, Georgia Tech s mission states that  The Georgia Tech community - students, staff, faculty, and alumni   will realize our motto of  Progress and Service  through effectiveness and innovation in teaching and learning, our research advances, and entrepreneurship in all sectors of the society.    This mission statement provides the working definition for Georgia Tech s economic engagement.   This is consistent with the Carnegie definition of economic engagement2.  In line with the strategic plan, Georgia Tech has organized itself with economic development responsibility placed with the Office of the Executive Vice President for Research (EVPR) with outreach entities such as the Enterprise Innovation Institute (EI2) under this office.   The EVPR, Stephen E. Cross, PhD., provides leadership for all research, economic development, and related support units.   The strategy today is to support the innovation ecosystem by creating transformative opportunities, strengthening partnerships, and maximizing societal impact.   As part of this strategy, Georgia Tech is pursuing an industry facing research strategy focused on leading-edge, use-inspired research and economic development3.   One example of Georgia Tech s commitment to economic development was the recognition and vote in April 2014 by the Faculty Assembly to establish  Extension Professional Titles  within the Research Faculty ranks of the institute.   This codifies the faculty status of the professionals at                                                            \n1 http://www.strategicvision.gatech.edu/sites/strategicvision.gatech.edu/files/Georgia_Tech_Strategic_Plan.pdf \n2 Carnegie:  Community Engagement describes the collaboration between institutions of higher education and their \nlarger communities (local, regional/state, national, global) for the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and \nresources in a context of partnership and reciprocity.  \n3  A Case Study of a Research University s Role in an Innovation Ecosystem , Stephen E. Cross. \nhttp://tlweb.rich.gatech.edu/research/sites/gatech.edu.research/files/Innvoation_Ecosystem_2012.pdf   7  \x0c Georgia Tech engaged in outreach and economic development activities and their participation in faculty governance of the Institute. 1.4 Economic Engagement Planning Georgia Tech s education, research, economic development, and related missions operate within a complex technology and innovation ecosystem that encompasses commercializing advanced technologies, developing spin-off and startup companies, helping established companies remain competitive, and attracting major technology companies to Georgia.  Georgia Tech s current strategic plan lays out a vision to build upon the Institute s strong education, research, technology, innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic development capability.  Georgia Tech is increasingly being seen as a destination for top-notch faculty and students, for established and startup technology firms, and as a leader in economic development strategy and deployment.   Building on these strengths and the results of this self-study, our application team has developed a growth and improvement plan that focuses on: 1) improving communications of economic development opportunities and successes; 2) improving ease of identification of Georgia Tech s expertise and resources for external stakeholders; 3) enhancing stakeholder partnerships.  \n 1.5 Promotion and Communication Georgia Tech s communications and marketing are managed and serviced by Georgia Tech Institute Communications.  This in-house, full-service resource provides communications and marketing support to all university units, including all aspects of economic development engagement.    Individual academic and research units also have designated communications staff who have a direct relationship to both Institute Communications and their unit.    The overall goal of the integrated strategic communications and marketing plan is to promote and advance world-class research and faculty that fosters increased government and industry support for the Institute\'s research enterprise and recognition of Georgia Tech s economic and societal impact.    8  \x0c   Strategies and tactics described in the plan are designed to address target audiences including (Figure 4):    Figure 4. Georgia Tech s Target Audiences for Strategic Communications Internal External   Campus Community   Faculty, Staff, Students \n  Research Centers \n  Corporate Relations \n  Advisory Boards      Industry Research Sponsors \n  Federal, State, and Local Government \n  Other Colleges & Universities  \n  Professional Societies and Trade Associations \n  Social Media Thought Leaders \n  Alumni  \n  Investment Community As part of a  market focused  strategy, Georgia Tech has recently implemented Interdisciplinary Research Institutes (IRIs) to increase engagement and ease industry access to the expertise and resources of the over 300 research centers at Georgia Tech.   These IRIs are staffed with market-aware professionals and provide an effective industry face to research programs and their economic development potential.   Today, ten IRIs have been organized around market areas such as energy, advanced manufacturing, robotics, etc.4  Georgia Tech is telling its economic engagement story to internal and external stakeholders through networking events, websites, and social media, for example:    Research@GT- http://www.research.gatech.edu    Enterprise Innovation Institute-http://innovate.gatech.edu    Georgia Tech News Center- www.news.gatech.edu    And social media5.     \n                                                           \n4 http://www.research.gatech.edu/institutes \n5 https://twitter.com/georgiatech; https://www.facebook.com/georgiatech  9  \x0c    1.6 Advancing University Economic Engagement Georgia Tech has taken a leadership role over the years in economic engagement, driving collaboration with the state s public and private leadership, the Georgia Department of Economic Development, the corporate community, and other educational institutions.  Three recent and ongoing examples of our leadership and engagement with peer institutions include the NSF I-Corps Program, EDA University Center partnerships, and Innovation Ecosystem Development.    a.  NSF I-Corps Program - In 2012, Georgia Tech was named as one of two inaugural regional nodes for the National Science Foundation s Innovation Corps Program (I-Corps). This groundbreaking grant program by the NSF was designed to support commercialization of technologies developed as a result of NSF sponsored research.  I-Corps educates professors, researchers, and PhD students at research universities throughout the U.S.  Georgia Tech teaching teams have run numerous cohorts of the I-Corps program, instructing over 100 teams of researchers, professors and students from research universities throughout the U.S.  In addition to teaching the I-Corps program, as regional node, Georgia Tech is also developing curriculums to teach students and community entrepreneurs a customer-first method of entrepreneurship in simulated startups. We are a leader in adopting NSF I-Corps based education and infusing it with Lean manufacturing methodologies to scale the teaching process. This is called Lean Customer Discovery. We have had over 300 entrepreneur projects participate in the Georgia Tech developed program.  Additionally, Lean Customer Discovery classes have been held at other universities in our region including the University of Florida, the University of Alabama and the University of Georgia.   10  \x0c b.  Partnership with EDA University Center - For over four decades, EI2 has operated a U.S. Economic Development Administration-funded University Center.   The EDA University Center utilizes the assets of EI2 and its Georgia Tech affiliates to strengthen regional economic ecosystems through the provision of technical assistance, strategic consulting, and applied research for university innovators.  The center is focused on two complementary areas: (1) technical assistance in support of innovation-based ecosystems and (2) strategic economic development support for communities.    Over the past five years, the center has provided leadership to practitioners at nine universities, including four member universities of APLU.  This assistance included an assessment of the university s intellectual property holdings, a review of its technology transfer and commercialization programs, and the identification and transfer of effective practices.   Many of the Center s practices are highlighted in a 2013 study conducted by SRI International6.  Through this study, the Center s best practices were shared with over 50 universities, including 40 member universities of APLU.     c.  Sharing best practices on innovation ecosystem development - EI2 has developed a methodology to assess innovation ecosystems in other cities and countries.  This methodology can be used to analyze the evolution of innovation ecosystems and uncover pathways for growth.    For example, EI2 recently used this methodology to develop a concept for an innovation center for Drexel University in Philadelphia.  Drexel is in the process of implementing this center to merge technology transfer, faculty commercialization, and industry collaborations under one unit.  This new structure will allow Drexel to become a better partner with startups and industry, moving and collaborating at the customer s pace.  We are also undertaking projects with universities in France and Puerto Rico.        \n                                                           \n6 Best Practices in EDA s University Center Program (http://ucbestpractices.uservoice.com)  11  \x0c    12  \x0c SECTION 2 \nSummary of Accomplishments (word count: 1901/2000) Georgia Tech s role in contributing to the state of Georgia s economy and beyond is well-stated in the Institute s 25-year strategic plan adopted in 2010:  As envisioned by our founders, Georgia Tech will continue to be an economic driver for Atlanta, the state of Georgia, and the nation, as exemplified by the innovative creation of the Georgia Research Alliance and by collaborative partnerships with institutions such as Emory University. But our scope and impact will extend worldwide as well. Georgia Tech will take the lead in creating a climate that not only celebrates basic research and scholarship, but also where research yields practical applications and where national and international collaborations yield commercial successes. We will create a culture where students and faculty are both scholars and entrepreneurs.  An economic impact study by the Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University of Georgia s Terry College of Business indicates that Georgia Tech made a $2.3 billion regional economic impact during the fiscal year 2011, the highest of any institution in the University System of Georgia (USG). The study also found that Georgia Tech generated 18,640 full- and part-time jobs.  Much of the economic impact in this study consists of initial spending for salaries and benefits, supplies and expenses, and other budgeted expenditures, as well as spending by students who attend the institutions. Georgia Tech also impacts the local and regional economy in several others ways, including:    Research partnerships with business and industry in the state of Georgia and throughout the Southeast to improve industry practices and promote technology transfer;    Economic development services to help make Georgia s small and medium-sized businesses and communities more innovative and efficient;    Research labs that produce more than 300 invention disclosures annually;    A strong patent portfolio, ranked eighth among the top 124 universities according to the 2009 Universities Patent Scorecard;  13  \x0c    Spinning off more than 10 new technology startup companies a year, building on an ecosystem of over 300 companies originating from Georgia Tech.  Additionally, it is estimated that Georgia Tech leverages its annual state support of approximately $7 million by over 14 to 1 in terms of economic impact to the State of Georgia alone.   Although Georgia Tech s economic impact is diverse and far reaching, the APLU self-study process highlighted three areas that have significantly contributed to its overall success in innovation and economic prosperity.  These include the Enterprise Innovation Institute, Technology Square, and educational programs in Entrepreneurship, Economic Development and STEM Outreach.  1. Enterprise Innovation Institute (EI2)  What began as an industrial extension program under a research institute in 1960 has grown and spun-off into the largest public university economic development program in the United States, the Enterprise Innovation Institute (EI2).  Today, EI2 is Georgia Tech s primary business outreach organization and serves as the primary vehicle to achieve Georgia Tech s goal of expanded local, regional, and global outreach for economic impact. EI2 includes over 100 extension faculty and  Perhaps more than any other research \nuniversity in North America, economic \ndevelopment is an integral, critical \ncomponent of the mission of Georgia \nTech.  Southern Growth Policies Board \nhttp://www.research.fsu.edu/techtransfer/documents/innovationu.pdf).   staff, and over 16 branded economic  development programs.  EI2 programs span from technology commercialization, entrepreneurial and startup company development, to manufacturing extension services and community economic development.  In addition, EI2 provides connections to Georgia Tech s vast resources, including world-class research, state-of-the-art facilities, internationally recognized experts, and students.  When compared to counterparts at other universities, EI2 is unique because it brings all of these areas of expertise into a single organization and connects clients to more than one program or service to meet individual needs.  14  \x0c As such, EI2 has broad and well-recognized experience in supporting all elements of an innovation ecosystem, including faculty commercialization, pre-incubation, incubation, acceleration, student entrepreneurship, and proof-of-concept centers.  EI2 has won many prestigious grants such as the U.S. Economic Development Administration Innovation 6 and Jobs Accelerator initiatives, which have led to two new commercialization gap programs for our ecosystem.   The EI2 technology business incubator, ATDC, was recently named by Forbes as one of the "Top 12 Business Incubators Changing the World.   As the graphic below depicts, EI2 is organized to accelerate technology commercialization, assist entrepreneurship, and amplify the expertise of Georgia Tech s broad expertise into society.              Enterprise Innovation Institute  -  EI2  Leading innovation in commercialization, entrepreneurship and extension \nservices Commercialization Entrepreneurship Extension Services Faculty Advising \nStartup formation Industry R&D  Incubation \nEducation \nMentoring Seed Investment  \n Manufacturing Healthcare \nProcurement Diversity \nEconomic Development Accelerate Assist Amplify   The impact of EI2 is significant. Detailed economic development metrics for EI2 are available at www.innovation.gatech.edu.   For example, over 150 technology startup companies that have graduated from our ATDC incubator and these firms have raised over $2 billion in private financing.     15  \x0c Today, Georgia Tech receives approximately $7 million in direct funding from the State of Georgia for economic development activity support. This funding goes directly to EI2 which manages the majority of economic development programs and is leveraged with additional Federal program and client fee support resulting in over $22 million in economic engagement services annually.    1.  Technology Square  Ten years ago, the innovation hub that is now Technology Square (Tech Square) was a dismal collection of empty lots and abandoned warehouses.  Georgia Tech s partnership with the business community, the State of Georgia and the City of Atlanta has boldly transformed that no-man s-land through a dramatic expansion of the Georgia Tech campus to Midtown Atlanta, creating a multi-faceted hub for innovation and economic development activity.  Today, Tech Square s 13 acre, 1.1 million square foot facilities include the Scheller College of Business, multidisciplinary research facilities, a Global Learning Center to promote the exchange of ideas, a conference hotel, and the economic development programs of EI2.   In addition, Tech Square includes the Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC) to incubate startups, Georgia Power s economic development team, the Georgia Department of Economic Development, and an array of other programs that connect industry to Georgia Tech and to the entrepreneurs who are driving new technologies.   In fact, all but one of the state s economic development entities are now located at Tech Square.    Corporate Innovation Centers are the most recent additions to this innovation hub and include the Panasonic Innovation Center, the ThyssenKrupp Elevator Innovation Center, and the AT&T  16  \x0c Foundry. These industry leaders are rapidly developing partnerships with startup companies, collaborating with research faculty, tapping into leading-edge research infrastructure, and creating co-op and internship programs for students   tomorrow s workforce.   Future innovations from these corporate innovation centers will be far-ranging from: the connected car and automotive information systems; unparalleled home and security services; cloud and mobile applications; new dimensions in machine-human interface; to additive manufacturing technologies.    As Georgia Tech President Peterson recently remarked,  Tech Square is a testament to what is possible when higher education, government, business, and the community work together.  In just 10 years, it has become the place to be for high tech innovators and entrepreneurs in the Southeast.       3. Education Programs in Entrepreneurship, Economic Development and STEM As part of a broad effort to foster economic engagement, innovation and entrepreneurship, Georgia Tech has launched a number of programs designed to provide education to campus innovators, entrepreneurs, economic development practitioners and middle and high school students.  Examples of these unique educational programs offered at Georgia Tech are detailed below.   a. Entrepreneurship programs     The Innovation Corps (I-Corps)   This program teaches National Science Foundation (NSF) grantees to identify valuable product opportunities that can emerge from academic research and offers entrepreneurship training to student participants. The primary goal of I-Corps is to foster entrepreneurship that will lead to the commercialization of technology that has been supported by NSF-funded research. Participants of the I-Corps program receive assistance in creating their startup company, creating a business model description for review by third-party investors, and gaining faster access to technology licenses.  The Georgia Tech I-Corps teaching team has taught 4 cohorts for a total of 93 teams. In addition, the teaching team is teaching new nodes across the U.S.   17  \x0c    Capstone Design   This is a series of courses offered to undergraduate students from all disciplines. Students work in teams to design, build, and test prototypes with real world applications. At the end of each semester students showcase their efforts at the  Capstone Design Expo.  The courses provide students the opportunity to work with real-world, open-ended, interdisciplinary challenges proposed by industrial and research project sponsors.     Startup Lab - This course is offered to undergraduate students; and it teaches students how to pursue startup creation. The curriculum includes presentations from guest entrepreneurs each week about their experience in a startup or entrepreneurial environment. Students then team up to develop a business model for a startup idea of their own under the guidance of instructors from the Georgia Tech VentureLab. There were 30 students enrolled in the first class offered in the Spring 2014 semester.  More classes will be offered in the future to meet the high demand for this course. b. Economic Development Programs Georgia Tech has provided professional development courses to assist economic development leaders for the past 47 years.  These courses are available through Georgia Tech s Enterprise Innovation Institute and are offered in partnership with the International Economic Development Council (IEDC).  IEDC courses count towards the certification and recertification of Certified Economic Developers (CEcD).  Below are some of the economic development courses held at Georgia Tech:   \n   Georgia Tech Basic Economic Development Course   provides an introduction to the core topic areas that make up comprehensive economic development, as well as insight on trends impacting the profession and practice of economic development.   IEDC Business Retention and Expansion   provides strategies on how to better attract and retain businesses in a local community.  18  \x0c   IEDC Credit Analysis - presents business financing tools and available private financing options, as well as how the public sector can complement bank financing.   IEDC Economic Development Marketing and Attraction - reviews the fundamentals of \ndeveloping and implementing a high-impact marketing and attraction plan.   IEDC Economic Development Strategic Planning   assists participants in understanding the complexity of strategic planning and its challenges.   IEDC Real Estate Development and Reuse - articulates the eight stage process for real \nestate development and reuse.   IEDC Technology-led Economic Development - introduces the legal and financial framework for bringing an innovation to market, including technology protection and product licensing.   It also explores the importance of knowledge to economic transitions has made science and technology key components of economic growth.  Georgia Tech administered seven economic development courses through IEDC this past year (February 2013-April 2014). These courses were attended by 455 economic development professionals. c. STEM Programs Georgia Tech offers a variety of educational/training opportunities to students and teachers that give participants the tools to contribute in impactful ways in Georgia s and the nation s technology and innovation economy.      One major accomplishment of Georgia Tech is the Institute s array of community STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) outreach programs. Programs offered by the Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics, and Computing (CEISMC) in collaboration with the Georgia Department of Education help  improve STEM education within the state via teacher professional development and advanced student course components. These components have reached over 20,000 students and more than 1,000 teachers.  In addition, CEISMC has partnered with numerous educational groups, schools, corporations, and community leaders throughout the state to ensure that K-12 students  19  \x0c receive the best preparation in STEM through numerous activities.     Georgia Intern-Fellowships for Teachers   This program places middle and high school STEM teachers into paid four-to-seven week summer internships in research laboratories to gain  real world  insight to transfer back to the classroom. More than 250 high school students in six years have participated alongside their teachers.     Summer Enrichment Programs - Georgia Tech hosts 18-24 different programs for middle and high school students each summer.

These insights are being communicated to the Georgia Tech leadership for inclusion in the Strategic Plan tasks moving forward.  Three key areas of improvement are highlighted below: 1)  Improve Communications of Economic Development Opportunities and Successes  A major component of the Georgia Tech Strategic Plan and the Georgia Tech Research Strategy is to expand the economic impact and global reach of the Institute. Currently, communications about Georgia Tech s economic development activities are managed by individual units with oversight and assistance of the Georgia Tech Institute Communications.  The findings of the internal survey indicated that communication improvement is recognized as an issue at all levels at Georgia Tech and that additional attention is needed to tell the full story about the overwhelming impact we are having on society and the economy.  90% of the survey responders indicated that communication of Georgia Tech s contributions and successes is important or very important, but 48% of the responders ranked Georgia Tech s performance 1-3 (out of 5).  This concern was also echoed in the feedback provided in the comments  section of the survey.  Dedicated staff for economic development communications and greater coordination of branding of the numerous economic development programs were specifically identified.  Based on these findings, the following improvement recommendations are planned:       Hiring a full-time Marketing and Communications Manager to support EI2 and its programs. The search will begin July 1, 2014.      Developing and executing a strategic marketing and communications plan solely focused on economic development activities, in conjunction with Institute Communications.  Members of Communications Department are currently working on the details of the plan 22  \x0c  and expect the plan to be implemented by December 31, 2014.     Identifying ways to leverage  success stories  to bring more attention to Georgia Tech s economic development contributions. The completion date for this recommendation is June 1, 2015.  Resources are still to be determined but may include creating an advertising budget, new websites, targeted campaigns in different areas of the state.       Creating an Impact on Georgia website that highlights Georgia Tech s impact and achievements across the state.  This website will allow the state s elected officials and industry leaders to recognize the tremendous societal and economic impact Georgia Tech has on the state and region. New collaborations and increased state support may result. The resources for this project are yet to be determined. It may include funding for web development, strategy consultants, etc.  Estimated completion date for this project is June 30, 2015.      Producing and promoting more stories about economic development activities, startup companies, industry outreach, etc.  The communications department is already doing this to a limited extent.  Our team recommends increasing this effort at the institute and unit level. A more complete understanding, among internal and external stakeholders, of the tremendous societal and economic impact Georgia Tech is having on the state and region is needed. The proposed  EI2 Marketing/Communications manager will develop new strategies for  telling our economic impact story , and help increase promotion of economic impact from the various Georgia Tech units   2)  Improve ease of identification of Georgia Tech expertise, resources, and programs for external stakeholders. As a large and complex institution, Georgia Tech recognizes that it can often be difficult for our stakeholders to connect to the right expertise or resource.  This was also confirmed by the surveys responders.  88% of the external stakeholders thought that  Openness, Accessibility and Responsiveness  was important or very important, but only 35% of the responders thought that Georgia tech was doing a great job in this area.   A number of efforts to improve access and  23  \x0c   thereby increase industrial engagement and sponsorship are currently underway.   All of these efforts are in-line with increasing our economic engagement by helping solve societal challenges.   Efforts to improve access include the continued growth of our Interdisciplinary Research Institutes (IRIs), implementation of GTScholar, and development of a searchable database of specialized GT facilities and equipment.  In addition, enhancement is continuing on a new contracting scheme, the Contract Continuum, to make it easier for industry and university researchers to engage at any point in the R&D process   from early-stage research to product launch.     Today, ten IRIs have been initiated and two more are planned.  These IRIs are providing a logical doorway for specific industrial segments such as energy or robotics to engage with Georgia Tech.   Details are each IRI shown below can be reviewed at http://www.research.gatech.edu/institutes.     Figure 5. Interdisciplinary Research Institutions        1.  Parker H. Petit Institute for Bioengineering & Bioscience 2.  Institute for Electronics and Nanotechnology 3.  Brook Byers Institute for Sustainable Systems 4.  Strategic Energy Institute 5.  Georgia Tech Manufacturing Institute 6.  Institute for Materials 7.  Georgia Tech Research Institute 8.  Institute of Paper Science and Technology 9.  Institute for People and Technology 10. Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines  24  \x0c  GTScholar will offer a service relevant to all Georgia Tech faculty members and researchers by compiling their research, teaching, publications, and professional activities information in one central location.  This will allow researchers and staff to more easily and effectively collaborate and connect external stakeholders with the right expert at Georgia Tech.  GTScholar is currently in Beta testing and plans are to fully implement it during 2015.  Lastly, Georgia Tech is currently developing a campus-wide database of specialized facilities and equipment to improve cross-campus sharing and broader access and use by external stakeholders.  Currently, this database is concentrating on equipment related to material research, but plans exist to expand it to all areas.   The database will include specifics on availability, capability, and costs.      Together, all of these efforts will improve ease of access for our external stakeholders.   This will be measured by the increase in the number of privately funded research, testing and development projects and the resulting increase in private versus government funding.  The institute has a goal of doubling the percentage of private entity sponsorship over the next five years.       3)  Leverage Tech Square to Enhance Partnerships Georgia Tech has an opportunity to enhance its engagement with economic partners by leveraging the assets of Tech Square.   The survey results indicated that Georgia Tech is doing a good job of facilitating interactions among the region s economic players with a score of nearly 4 out of 5 from external stakeholders.  However, the discussions during the feedback forum indicated that an opportunity exists to do even more by increasing the interaction of the economic partners located at Tech Square and working together to collaborate on strategic efforts.   As described earlier, Tech Square has physically brought together nearly all the economic development agencies of the state including Georgia Tech, the Georgia Department  25  \x0c   of Economic Development and a number of private sector economic development groups such as the Georgia Power Resource Center.  This co-location has been useful and convenient, but to date it has not resulted in any regular process of networking and collaboration.  Additionally, Tech Square is also not well known throughout the state as a central resource and location for its wide variety of economic development services and partners.     It is proposed that Georgia Tech lead an effort to establish more formal networking among the partners at Tech Square and establish a mechanism to share opportunities and successes.    As a lead for Georgia Tech s economic efforts, EI2 will establish a  Tech Square Partners Network  to increase the visibility of Tech Square as a state economic development resource and to facilitate more partner interaction and coordination.   Proposed activities of the network include hosting a landing page summarizing the partners, their services, and contact information; scheduling regular networking meetings; advertising partnering opportunities among the network members; and communicating economic development successes to stakeholders.      26  \x0c Growth/Improve\nment Goal \nGoal 1: Improve \nCommunications \nof Economic \nDevelopment \nSuccesses  \n Table 2.
